                     <h1>INTO Drew University Terms &amp; Conditions — 2017-18</h1>
                     <p>
                        <strong>For 2016-17 Terms, <a href="/Downloads/Terms/US/into-new-york-at-drew-terms-and-conditions.pdf" target="_blank">click here</a></strong>
                     </p>
                     <p><strong>1. Application of the Terms and Conditions</strong><br><br>a. These are the Terms and Conditions of the agreement between Drew University (the University), INTO Drew University and the&nbsp;student that are effective upon completion of the confirmation&nbsp;process, as detailed in Section 3 below. These Terms and Conditions supersede any promises, representations and warranties, whether written or oral, made by or on behalf of the student, INTO Drew University and/or the University. The University and INTO Drew University reserve the right to amend&nbsp; the Terms and Conditions as needed. In such circumstances, the University or INTO Drew University will provide the student with a revised set of Terms and Conditions upon request.<br><br>b. Students will be subject to these requirements and should read&nbsp; these Terms and Conditions very carefully before signing and submitting their offer of admission/acceptance form to INTO Drew University.<br><br>c. The registration and student legal status of INTO Drew University&nbsp;students will be subject to all federal and state laws.<br><br>d. All students are responsible for knowing and abiding by all&nbsp;University and/or INTO Drew University Policies, Regulations and&nbsp;Code of Student Conduct, as amended from time to time. These&nbsp;can be found <a href="http://www.drew.edu" target="_blank">here</a>.<br><br>e. The University and INTO Drew University may assign or sub-contract in whole or part some or all of the benefit and/or burden&nbsp;of this agreement without any approval from the student.</p>
                     <p><strong>2. Definitions</strong><br><br>a. “Program” refers to individual courses of study. Programs offered&nbsp;by INTO Drew University include: Academic English (AE) and&nbsp;Pathway (PW).<br><br>b. “Study Plan” refers to the entirety of Program(s) offered and&nbsp;accepted by the student at the time of admission. If the student&nbsp;has made multiple selections (AE and PW), the Study Plan is the&nbsp;entire period of time needed to complete all Programs.<br></p>
                     <p><strong>3. Admissions, Program Offer, Confirmation and Deposit</strong><br><br>a. If the student is admitted, INTO Drew University will issue a&nbsp;written offer. As described in the offer letter, in order to accept&nbsp;the offer, the student must sign the acceptance letter and if&nbsp;applicable, remit a deposit payment to INTO Drew University.&nbsp;This completes the confirmation process and denotes&nbsp;acceptance of these terms and conditions.<br><br>b. Completing the confirmation process ensures the student’s&nbsp;enrollment and/or confirms a housing reservation. The deposit&nbsp;is only refundable in the event that a student is unable to meet&nbsp;visa entry requirements, subject to the receipt of an official visa&nbsp;rejection letter by the published start date of the Study Plan.<br><br>c. Where a student has selected more than one Program as part of&nbsp;their Study Plan, the higher deposit amount will be required.<br><br>d. If a student enters the US on an I-20 based upon a PathwayProgram, the student will be bound by Pathway Program Terms&nbsp;and Conditions.<br><br>e. Students are required to pay the following deposit(s) to&nbsp;ensure their enrollment in a Program and/or confirm a housing&nbsp;reservation:<br><br>i) $2,000 for Academic English/Pathway tuition<br><br>ii) $2,000 for housing<br><br>f. Upon INTO Drew University’s receipt of the signed acceptance&nbsp;form and paid deposit, if applicable, the student will receive&nbsp;a confirmation letter indicating his/her enrollment, I-20 if&nbsp;applicable, and the invoice for the remaining balance due.</p>
                     <p><strong>4. Full Payment</strong><br><br>a. The remaining outstanding balance must be paid four (4) weeks&nbsp;prior to the published start date of the student’s Study Plan. ForPW or AE plus PW, all AE (if any) plus the full&nbsp;first year of PW plus&nbsp;a deposit for year two of PW must be remitted.<br><br>b. If a student is applying for a scholarship from a government&nbsp;sponsor, the student will be required to either (i) pay in full,&nbsp;or (ii) provide a letter of&nbsp;financial guarantee from the sponsor&nbsp;by the end of the third week of classes/the term for AE/PWPrograms. Students with unofficial letters of&nbsp;financial guarantee&nbsp;will be allowed to register for classes, but if the official letter of&nbsp;financial guarantee is not received by the deadline, students will&nbsp;be subject to withdrawal from their classes and dis-enrollment&nbsp;from the INTO Drew University Program, as well as from DrewUniversity. An official letter of&nbsp;financial guarantee must specify&nbsp;that the guarantee covers the entire program of study at INTODrew University. Sponsors will be invoiced for their portion&nbsp;of fees, and the student will be refunded any credit balance&nbsp;remaining on his/her account after payment has been received&nbsp;from the sponsor.</p>
                     <p><strong>5. Overdue Payment</strong><br><br>a. In cases of overdue payment, the University will suspend or&nbsp;cancel enrollment for students who do not have a pre-agreed&nbsp;arrangement with the University in writing for late payment.&nbsp;Interest on the outstanding balance will be charged at the rate&nbsp;of 2% per month (24% APR).</p>
                     <p><strong>6. Health Insurance</strong><br><br>a. The University requires non-immigrant international students to&nbsp;be covered by health insurance, which meets the US Government’s&nbsp;visa requirements and University requirements.<br><br>i) The full cost of an INTO Drew Student Health Insurance Plan&nbsp;will be added to the invoice.<br><br>ii) Students relying on their own health insurance coverage,&nbsp;or other sources of coverage, including sponsored provided&nbsp;coverage, must have coverage that meets or exceeds&nbsp;the coverage offered by the University plan. Coverage&nbsp;requirements may be found <a href="https://www.drew.edu/health" target="_top">here</a>.<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span><br><br>iii) General health insurance information may be found <a href="http://www.drew.edu/health" target="_top">here</a>.<br>
                        <span style="white-space: pre;"></span><span style="white-space: pre;"></span><br>iv) Information on required immunizations and any required&nbsp;screening tests, such as tuberculosis, is available <a href="https://www.drew.edu/health" target="_top">here</a>.&nbsp;Students are expected to meet the requirements indicated and&nbsp;must have all pre-entry immunizations completed prior to arrival&nbsp;or must make arrangements at Drew Health Services immediately&nbsp;upon arrival to receive any required immunizations or screens they&nbsp;do not have.
                     </p>

                     <p><strong>7.3 Withdrawal</strong><br><br>a. If the student does not meet the conditions of the offer letter and&nbsp;the offer of admission is withdrawn, no cancellation fees will be&nbsp;payable by the student provided that the student informs INTO&nbsp;Drew University in writing and sends evidence that the conditions&nbsp;have not been met. This information must be received no later&nbsp;than four (4) weeks before the Program start date.</p>
                     <p><strong>7.4 Transfers to Another Institution Prior to the Start orCompletion of the Pathway</strong><br><br>a. If a student is in an INTO Drew University Program and transfers to&nbsp;an INTO Partner School, INTO Drew University will transfer tuition&nbsp;fees if the student’s request is made prior to the published start&nbsp;date for the INTO Drew University Program.<br><br>i) If the transfer request to another INTO partner school is&nbsp;made after the INTO Drew University Program’s published&nbsp;start date, there will be no transfer of tuition for the currently&nbsp;enrolled term/session, but the remaining tuition paid will be&nbsp;transferred to the future INTO Partner School.<br><br>ii) If a student has agreed to attend an INTO Drew University&nbsp;Pathway Program, and the transfer request is made to an&nbsp;institution outside of the INTO partner schools on or after&nbsp;the published start date, there will be no transfer of any fees.<br><br>iii) All transfers are subject to the Accommodations Changes and&nbsp;Cancellation requirements set forth below in Section 8.1.</p>
                     <p><strong>8. Housing Accommodations</strong><br><br>a. The University agrees to make every reasonable effort to provide&nbsp;the housing accommodation as requested by the student. If&nbsp;unable to do so, the University reserves the right to provide, inits discretion, an alternative housing accommodation, which will&nbsp;be charged at the published rate as set forth in the description of&nbsp;fees contained in the offer letter. Housing accommodations are&nbsp;confirmed when full fees are paid.<br><br>b. All students living in on-campus housing accommodations while&nbsp;enrolled in INTO Drew University Programs are required to have a&nbsp;dining plan, which is part of the accommodation cost.<br><br>c. All full-time enrolled undergraduate students at the University&nbsp;are required to live on campus during their years of study at&nbsp;the University, including students in INTO Drew University&nbsp;Undergraduate Pathway Program or Academic English, as well as&nbsp;those students taking any required Academic English courses prior&nbsp;to the start of the Pathway program.<br><br>i) Limited exceptions to this requirement may be found <a href="http://www.drew.edu/reslife/for-our-students/undergraduate-housing/residency-policy" target="_top">here</a>.<br><br>d.

                     <p><strong>8.1 Accommodation Changes or Cancellation<br></strong><br>a. A housing deposit must be made by those students who&nbsp;are required to live in University housing. The student will be&nbsp;responsible for housing charges for the entire term as specified&nbsp;in the offer letter’s statement of fees, except as provided in&nbsp;Section 8.1(a) (i) to (iv) below. Agreement to these requirements&nbsp;is effective upon signing of the acceptance form. Canceling&nbsp;accommodations after payment of the INTO housing deposit will&nbsp;result in the following cancellation fees:<br><br>i) For students who cancel their on-campus housing at least&nbsp;four (4) weeks prior to the published start date of their&nbsp;Program or Study Plan, the cancellation fee will be the cost of&nbsp;the housing deposit.<br><br>ii) For students who do not cancel their on-campus housing at&nbsp;least four (4) weeks prior to the published start date of their&nbsp;Program or Study Plan, the cancellation fee will be the greater&nbsp;of the housing deposit or the established individual daily&nbsp;room rate for the remainder of the housing contract.

Exemption&nbsp;requests received after the four-week deadline (which are&nbsp;granted) will be treated as cancellations, and as such will incur&nbsp;cancellation fees as outlined in Section (i) or (ii) above.<br><br>iv) Students who are dismissed or suspended from their Program, the University and/or University housing, will be charged&nbsp;cancellation fees as outlined in these Terms and Conditions.<br>b. At the University’s or INTO Drew University’s discretion, a student&nbsp;may appeal the cancellation fees for housing by submitting a&nbsp;petition to INTO Drew University. Appeals must be based upon&nbsp;one or more of the following reasons<br><br>i) The student has completed his/her entire Study Plan.<br><br>ii) The student has suffered significant and/or unforeseeable&nbsp;financial hardships outside the student’s reasonable control.<br><br>iii) The student has documented an unforeseen medical&nbsp;disability, which the University is unable to accommodate and&nbsp;which requires the student to live off campus.<br><br>iv) The student has been unable to meet visa entry&nbsp;requirements, as evidenced by an official visa rejection letter.<br>
                        <span style="white-space: pre;"></span>If a waiver or cancellation has been requested and approved&nbsp;charges will not be&nbsp;finalized until the student has vacated his or&nbsp;her housing. Additional charges may be incurred by the student if&nbsp;the housing or facility has not been properly cleaned or there is&nbsp;lost/damaged property.
                     </p>
                     <p><strong>9. Student Conduct</strong><br><br>a. Students are required to abide by the policies, rules, and&nbsp;requirements of the University, as well as laws of municipalities&nbsp;and counties, the State of New Jersey, and the United States ofAmerica.<br><br>b. Students are subject to and required to comply with Drew’s&nbsp;community standards, and abide by the Drew University Code&nbsp;of Student Conduct, found in the Student Handbook, known&nbsp;as Daniel’s Dictionary, which also includes the Drew SexualHarassment and Misconduct Policy, the Human Rights Policy and&nbsp;academic policies. Such requirements may be amended from time&nbsp;to time. Daniel’s Dictionary may be found <a href="http://uknow.drew.edu/confluence/display/Handbook/Daniel%27s+Dictionary" target="_top">here</a>.<br><br>c. Information about Residence Life and Community Standards maybe found <a href="http://www.drew.edu/reslife" target="_top">here</a>.&nbsp;Information about academic standards and&nbsp;policies may also be found in Daniel's Dictionary <a href="http://uknow.drew.edu/confluence/display/Handbook/University+Student+Conduct+Policy+and+Procedures" target="_top">here</a>.<br><br>d. Failure to abide by conduct regulations and relevant laws may lead&nbsp;to suspension and/or dismissal from the University and/or from&nbsp;INTO Drew University. Students who are placed on suspension&nbsp;or are dismissed due to violations of the student conduct code,&nbsp;academic requirements, or criminal law violations are responsible&nbsp;for payment of all student charges, including tuition, housing,&nbsp;dining, technology, activity, and insurance charges or fees.</p>
                     <p><strong>10. Appeals</strong><br><br>a. Students may challenge academic and conduct decisions through the procedures for appeals and grievances set forth in Daniel’s Dictionary. Information on appeal procedures is available in Daniel’s Dictionary, which may be amended from time to time. Students are responsible for understanding their obligations as students and are expected to read Daniel’s Dictionary other student-related policies in entirety.</p>
                     <p><strong>11. Late Arrivals</strong><br><br>a. All students are expected to arrive at INTO Drew University one day before, the scheduled start date for orientation. All students are expected to start their Study Plan on the scheduled start date. All late arrivals must be approved by the University/INTO Drew University in advance and will be considered on a case-by-case basis. No deposits, tuition, accommodation costs, or other&nbsp;fees will be refunded for late arrivals (late fees may apply as&nbsp;described below). Any revision of the Study Plan will most likely&nbsp;involve additional time and expenditure with regard to tuition&nbsp;and accommodation fees.&nbsp;NOTE: There are strict deadlines for Program entrance. An&nbsp;unapproved late arrival may result in the student being unable&nbsp;to attend classes for the term, and may also require that the&nbsp;student return to his/her country until the next available term.</p>

Students in AE classes who fail to attend 60% in each of their&nbsp;classes will be dismissed from their program at the end of the&nbsp;semester.<br><br>d.

Pathway Programs are designed to be completed in two (2)&nbsp;academic years or four (4) semesters; depending on the specific&nbsp;Pathway Program type; additional courses may be required over&nbsp;summer or added to a fall/spring semester. Pathway study can&nbsp;be extended beyond that subject to students who meet required&nbsp;academic criteria, to be assessed on a case-by-case basis.<br><br>b. Semester 3 of the Pathway Program will always begin in fall semester.
                        </p>

Students are accepted in good faith into both English language&nbsp;and academic Programs on the basis of the certification they&nbsp;provide to meet the admissions criteria. If, however, the results&nbsp;from the tests and assessment procedures upon arrival indicate&nbsp;that a student’s actual level of English language or academic&nbsp;proficiency is significantly different than the one claimed and&nbsp;is lower than the one required for their designated Program,&nbsp;then the student will be formally advised of the results and&nbsp;of applicable options. Students need to be aware that if an&nbsp;alternative Study Plan is advised, there may be a significant&nbsp;change in study time and expenditure with regard to tuition and&nbsp;accommodation fees.<br><br>b. A student, either individually or through his/her representative,&nbsp;who has submitted any documentation or certification to meet&nbsp;the admissions criteria which is later found to have been falsified&nbsp;is subject to immediate dismissal from the University.<br><br>c. Currently enrolled Academic English students who are planning&nbsp;to enter a Pathway or University degree-seeking program must&nbsp;also meet the following requirements to progress:<br><br>i) Completion of current Academic English term in good standing.<br><br>ii) Completion of current Academic English term (this includes&nbsp;all graded Academic English classes in any level) in good&nbsp;standing with a grade of C or better in Writing/Grammar,&nbsp;Reading/Vocabulary and Listening/Speaking classes and&nbsp;passing grades in elective content.<br><br>iii) Current enrollment must not be more than one (1) language&nbsp;level below the desired entry level.&nbsp;NOTE: This includes students who meet the language&nbsp;proficiency requirement on a qualifying test score.
