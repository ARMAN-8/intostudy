                     <p>
                        <strong>1. Application of the Terms and Conditions<br>
                        </strong><br>a.	These are the terms and conditions of the agreement between Oregon State University (the University) and the student. These terms and conditions are effective upon completion of the confirmation process. These terms and conditions supersede any promises, representations and warranties, whether written or oral, made by or on behalf of the student or the University.<br>
                        <br>b.	Students should read these terms and conditions very carefully before submitting their application for admission.<br>
                        <br>c.	All students are bound by the standards, policies and procedures of the University as amended from time to time. These can be found at: leadership.oregonstate.edu/policies. The University may assign or sub-contract, in whole or in part, some or all of the benefit and/or burden of this agreement without any approval from the student.<br>
                        <br>d.	Definitions:<br>
                        <br>i.	Program (Program) refers to General English (GE), Academic English (AE), Study Abroad with English (SAWE), Visiting International Student Program (VISP), College Year Abroad (CYA) and Pathway (PW).<br>
                        <br>ii.	The admitted study plan (study plan) refers to the entirety of Program(s) offered and accepted by the student at the time of admission. If the student has made multiple selections (GE, AE and PW), the study plan is the entire period of time needed to complete all selections.
                     </p>
                     <p><strong>2.1	Changes to the Terms and Conditions<br>
                        </strong><br>a.	The University reserves the right to amend the terms and conditions. In such circumstances, the University will provide the student with a revised set of terms and conditions upon request and the University will attempt to notify students of substantive changes. The University also makes these terms and conditions available at webpage below and it is the students responsibility to check regularly.&nbsp;www.intostudy.com/osu/terms
                     </p>
                     <p><strong>3.1	Application, Admissions, Program Offer, Confirmation and Deposit<br>
                        </strong><br>a.	Students should complete their application and submit it to Oregon State University’s International Admissions office.<br>
                        <br>b.	If the student is admitted, the University will issue a written offer. As described in the offer letter, in order to accept the offer, the student must sign the acceptance letter and, if applicable, remit a deposit payment. This completes the confirmation process and denotes acceptance of the offer and of these terms and conditions. Completing this confirmation process confirms the student’s enrollment, and housing reservation as outlined below.&nbsp;<br>
                        <br>c.	Once the confirmation process is complete, the deposit is only refundable in the event that a student is unable to meet visa entry requirements, subject to the receipt of an official visa rejection letter by the published start date of the student’s study plan. See 7.2 for relevant cancellation details for students who have met visa entry requirements.<br>
                        <br>d.	Where a student has selected more than one Program as part of his or her study plan, the higher deposit amount will be required.<br>
                        <br>e.	If a student enters the United States on an I-20 based with the PW Program as the ultimate study goal, the student will be bound by the PW Program terms and conditions.
                     </p>
                     <p><strong>4.1	Full Payment<br>
                        </strong><br>a.	The remaining outstanding balance must be paid four (4) weeks prior to the published start date of the student’s study plan. Any variation to standard payment terms must be made in advance and agreed to by the University and the student in writing. Unless otherwise agreed to in writing, or if the below government sponsored student exception is met (b.), full payment must be made prior to registration.<br>
                        <br>b.	If a student arrives with an unofficial financial guarantee letter from a sponsoring body, the student will be required to either (i) pay in full or (ii) provide an official letter of financial guarantee from the sponsor by the end of the first week of classes for all Programs. Students with unofficial letters of financial guarantee will be allowed to register for classes, but if the official letter of financial guarantee is not received by the deadline (or the student has not paid in full), students will be withdrawn from their classes and disenrolled from the INTO Oregon State University Program.<br>
                        <br>i.	An official letter of financial guarantee must specify that the guarantee covers the entire academic term. Sponsors will be invoiced for their portion of fees, and the student will be refunded any credit balance remaining on his/her account after payment has been received from the sponsor.<br>
                        <br>ii.	Sponsored students who wish to have their Oregon State University health insurance waived due to sponsor-provided coverage must comply with Oregon State University Student Health Services waiver requirements.
                     </p>
                     <p><strong>5.1	Overdue Payment<br>
                        </strong><br>a.	In cases of overdue payment, the University reserves the right to suspend or cancel enrollment for students who do not have a pre-agreed arrangement with the University in writing for late payment, and to charge interest on the outstanding balance. Interest will be charged at the rate of 1% per month (12% APR).
                     </p>
                     <p><strong>6.1	Health Insurance<br>
                        </strong><br>a.	The University requires non-immigrant international students to be covered by health insurance which meets the US Government’s visa requirements, State of Oregon and Oregon State University requirements. Students unable to provide evidence of adequate coverage at the time of their application are required to purchase the University International Student Insurance coverage as a condition of enrollment.<br>
                        <br>i.	Students who have health insurance coverage that meets or exceeds the coverage offered by the University International Student Insurance plan may request a waiver by completing the process through the University Student Health Center Insurance Office. The waiver form may be found at: studenthealth.oregonstate.edu/sites/studenthealth.oregonstate.edu/files/intl_waiver_form_2016-17.doc<br>
                        <br>ii.	General health insurance information may be found at: <a href="http://studenthealth.oregonstate.edu/internationalplan">studenthealth.oregonstate.edu/internationalplan</a>

                        <br>c.	All change requests must be received two (2) weeks prior to the published Program start date of the new Program.
                     </p>
                     <p><strong>7.4	Withdrawal<br>
                        </strong><br>a.	There will be no refund for students who cancel or withdraw from any INTO Oregon State University Program after the published start date.<br>
                        <br>b.	If the student does not meet the conditions of the offer letter and the offer of admission is withdrawn, no cancellation fees will be payable by the student provided that the student informs INTO Oregon State University in writing and sends evidence that the conditions have not been met. This information must be received no later than four (4) weeks before the Program start date or cancellation fees will apply.
                     </p>

                        </strong><br>a.	If a student is in an INTO Oregon State University GE, CYA, SAWE, VISP or AE Program and transfers to an INTO partner school, any INTO Oregon State University tuition fees will transfer if the request is made prior to the published start date for the INTO Oregon State University Program.<br>
                        <br>i.	If the transfer request is made after the INTO Oregon State University Program’s published start date, there will be no transfer of tuition for the current term/session, but the remaining tuition paid will be transferred to the future INTO partner school.<br>
                        <br>b.	Housing cancellation fees described below will apply.<br>
                        <br>c.	If a student has agreed to attend an INTO Oregon State University PW Program, and has begun the Program, there will be no transfer of any fees.
                     </p>
                     <p><strong>8.1	Accommodations<br>
                        </strong><br>a.	On application, students may indicate their preferred on-campus accommodations. Payment of the housing deposit confirms that space will be held for you in on campus accommodations.<br>
                        <br>i.	The application allows students to indicate their preferred accommodation type. The University agrees to make every reasonable effort to place the student into their preferred accommodation type as requested. If unable to do so, the University reserves the right to provide an alternative type of accommodation, which will be charged at the published rate.<br>
                        <br>b.	Students living in University accommodations are required to abide by the Terms and Conditions of the Room and Dining Contract, as well as the Student Policy and Information Guide. In the case of a conflict, these Terms and Conditions will control.<br>
                        <br>c.	Due to the decrease in on-campus occupancy during the Oregon State University Summer Term (June-September), the University may determine that some students need to move rooms to a new residence hall in June or in September.&nbsp; Move notifications will be sent during the Spring Term.<br>
                        <br>d.	As a component of the comprehensive First Year Experience (FYE) at Oregon State University, full-time, first-year students who enroll at OSU within one year of high school graduation must live on campus, regardless of class standing, in a University-owned and operated residence for their first three (3) terms of enrollment.&nbsp; This FYE housing requirement applies to Undergraduate PW students and AE students with an Undergraduate PW in their study plan.<br>
                        <br>i.	Exemptions from the FYE housing requirement&nbsp; are only 		available under the&nbsp; circumstances outlined on the University 		Housing and Dining website and can be found at:&nbsp;main.oregonstate.edu/fye/first-year-live-policy<br>
                        <br>ii.	A student seeking a waiver of this requirement must submit a written request to the INTO Oregon State University Housing Office at least four (4) weeks prior to the published start date. Waiver requests received after the 4-week deadline will be treated as cancellations (see section 8.3.2.iii).
                     </p>
                     <p><strong>8.2	Accommodation Changes or Cancellation<br>
                        </strong><br>a.	If a student has specified his/her intent to stay in University housing, the student must pay a housing deposit in the confirmation process and the student will be responsible for housing charges for the entire term specified in his/her application form. A student who cancels accommodation after payment of the INTO Oregon State University housing deposit will be subject to the following cancellation policies:<br>
                        <br>i.	For students who cancel their on-campus housing in writing at least four (4) weeks prior to the published start date of their Program or study plan, the cancellation fee will be the housing deposit.<br>
                        <br>ii.	For students who cancel their on-campus housing in writing less than four (4) weeks prior to the published start date of their Program or study plan, the cancellation fee will be the greater of the housing deposit or the established daily rate for the remainder of the housing contract.<br>
                        <br>iii.	Students who fall under the FYE housing requirement who cancel their housing prior to fulfillment of the three (3) term requirement will not receive any housing refund.<br>
                        <br>iv.	Housing waiver requests must be submitted at least four (4) weeks prior to the published start date. Waiver requests received after the 4-week deadline will be treated as cancellations.<br>
                        <br>v.	Homestay Cancellation: 30-day notice is required to cancel a Homestay placement after the housing start date. For students who cancel a Homestay placement after the housing start date, the cancellation fee will be the greater of the Homestay deposit or the remainder of the 30-day notice.

                        <br>b.	Students are subject to the standards of conduct as described by University rules and policies, as amended from time to time. Information regarding student conduct may be referenced at the following website: <a href="http://studentlife.oregonstate.edu/studentconduct/">studentlife.oregonstate.edu/studentconduct</a><br>
                        <br>c.	Failure to abide by conduct regulations and relevant laws may lead to suspension or expulsion from the University. This may impact your immigration status, so please review the Student Conduct Code carefully.

                        </strong><br>a.	All students are expected to arrive and start their study plan on the scheduled start date. All late arrivals must be approved by INTO OSU in advance and will be considered on a case-by-case basis. No deposits, tuition, accommodation costs, or other fees will be refunded for late arrivals (and late fees may apply, as described below). Any revision of the study plan will most likely involve additional time and expenditure with regard to tuition and accommodation fees.<br>
                        <br>b.	There are strict deadlines for Program entrance. An arrival after the deadline will likely result in the student being unable to attend INTO Oregon State University classes for the term, and may also require that the student return to his/her country until the next available term. Students who enter the United States but cannot enroll will need to work with the University and INTO Oregon State University to arrange readmission and new visa documents.
                     </p>

                        </strong><br>a.&nbsp;Refunds of any payments made to INTO OSU&nbsp;will only be made to the individual or organisation that originally paid the funds. If a third party has paid the funds on behalf of the Student we are unable to refund the funds directly to the Student and any refund will be made directly to the third party who originally paid the funds.<br>
                        <br>b. Refunds of any payments made to INTO OSU can only be made to the account from which the payment was made originally. Proof of payment such as a receipt or a bank statement showing payment from that account must be produced for a refund to take place. Failure to do so may delay the refund severely or prevent it altogether.<br>
                        <br>c. Refunds will not be paid via cash. INTO OSU reserves the right not to accept any payment by cash at its own discretion.

                        </strong><br>a.	All requests to defer a Program must be received four (4) weeks prior to the published Program start date, unless in the case of a visa denial. Students may make two (2) requests to defer the Program start date without penalty. Any additional deferral requests will result in a $300 Program deferral fee.&nbsp;<br>
                        <br>b.	An express mail fee will be charged every time express mail is used to send Program documents.<br>
                        <br>c.	Students who submit deferral requests after the 4-week deadline will be assessed Program cancellation penalties as described in section 7.1.
                     </p>
                     <p><strong>16.1	Academic Criteria<br>
                        </strong><br>a.	Students are accepted into their study plan with the strict understanding that progression through the study plan and successful completion of any Program are conditional upon satisfactory attendance and successful attainment of all progression requirements. During the International Student Orientation, all students will be made aware of the criteria for successful completion of the courses in their study plan. The assessment of student academic performance is the responsibility of the course instructor.<br>
                        <br>b.	Currently enrolled students in GE, CYA, AE, SAWE, VISP or PW Programs who are planning to enter a Pathway, Transitional&nbsp; Admission Program (CAP), or OSU degree-seeking Program must also meet the following requirements to progress:<br>
                        <br>i.	Completion of current term enrollment in Good Attendance Standing.<br>
                        <br>ii.	Completion of current term academic Program (this includes all graded Academic English classes in any level) with a grade of C or better in Reading/Writing, Listening/Speaking and passing grades in elective courses.<br>
                        <br>iii.	Current enrollment must be at least AE level three (3) or higher and not be more than one language level below the desired entry level.<br>
                        <br>Note: This includes students who meet the language proficiency requirement based on a qualifying test score.<br>
                        For a complete description of the progression requirements, please refer to: <a href="http://blogs.oregonstate.edu/intoosu/osu-policies/test-scores-progress-pw-cap/">blogs.oregonstate.edu/intoosu/osu-policies/test-scores-progress-pw-cap/</a><br>
                        <br>c.	Students who do not meet the criteria for successful completion will not be allowed to proceed with their original study plan. Students may be offered advice on suitable alternative study options, which may include retaking courses or changing their study plan. An alternative study plan may involve additional time and expenditure with regard to tuition and accommodation fees.<br>
                        <br>d.	Many students find it difficult to complete all requirements for an undergraduate degree in just four (4) years of study (attending only three [3] terms per year). They typically need to enroll in one (1) or more summer terms to stay on track to graduate in four (4) years.
                     </p>
                     <p><strong>16.2	Academic Standing<br>

                        <br>b.	Students may not repeat any Reading and Writing (R&amp;W) or Listening and Speaking (L&amp;S) course more than three (3) times. If an AE student does not pass an R&amp;W or an L&amp;S course after three (3) attempts, he/she will be academically suspended from his/her Program and will not be admissible to Oregon State University (including INTO Oregon State University Programs).
                     </p>
                     <p><strong>16.3	Attendance Standing<br>

                        <br>c.	Students on Attendance Probation who fail to attend 70% of any one of their courses will be placed on Attendance Suspension at the end of the Probation term.<br>

                        </strong><br>a.	Students are not eligible for a vacation term until they have completed nine (9) consecutive months of full-time enrollment in an academic Program.<br>
                        <br>b.	PW Program students are only eligible for a vacation term after finishing three (3) terms of PW study regardless of how many consecutive months they have already been enrolled. This includes students enrolled in one (1) and two (2) term PW Programs.
                     </p>
                     <p><strong>16.5	Duration of Pathway Programs<br>
                        </strong><br>a.	PW Programs are designed to be completed in 1 (one), 2 (two), three (3) or four (4) terms as determined at admission based on academic and English qualifications.<br>
                        <br>b. 	PW study can be extended on a term- by-term basis for a total of two (2) extension terms beyond the original PW Program duration; any approved vacation or medical reduced course load taken after the original PW Program duration registered for less than 12 credits will not&nbsp; be included in the PW term count total. Students may appeal for an additional PW term beyond the two (2) extension terms; appeals for additional PW extension terms will be considered by an appeals committee on a case-by-case basis.

                        </strong><br>a.	For all English language Programs, classes will normally be held Monday through Friday, anytime between 8 am and 8 pm. Average class size is normally eighteen (18) students. Where appropriate, classes may be combined for university-style lectures.<br>
                        <br>b.	For academic Programs, classes will generally be held Monday through Friday, and may be in lecture, seminar, or workshop format. Class sizes will vary, depending on the learning format (i.e., lecture, seminar and lab).
                     </p>
                     <p><strong>17.1	Program Admissions Criteria<br>
                        </strong><br>a.	Students are accepted in good faith into both English language and academic Programs on the basis of the certification they provide to meet the admissions criteria. If, however, the results from the tests and assessment procedures upon arrival provide evidence that a student’s actual level of English language or academic proficiency is significantly different than the one claimed and is lower than the one required for the designated Program, then the student will be formally advised of the results and of applicable options. Students need to be aware that if an alternative study plan is advised, there may be a significant change in study time and expenditure with regard to tuition and accommodation fees.<br>
                        <br>b.	A student, either individually or through his/her representative, who has submitted any documentation or certification to meet the admissions criteria which is found to have been falsified may be subject to immediate dismissal from the University and may be subject to Student Conduct and Community Standards review, which may result in further disciplinary action.

                     <p><strong>19.1	Student Information<br>
                        </strong><br>a.	At the time of application, students are requested to sign a release authorizing Oregon State University to share information about the student with parents and/or representatives.
