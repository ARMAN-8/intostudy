                     <h2><strong>INTO Colorado State&nbsp;University<br>Terms &amp; Conditions—2017-18</strong></h2>
                     <p><strong>For 2016-17 Terms, <a href="/Downloads/Terms/US/into-csu-terms-and-conditions.pdf" target="_blank">click here</a></strong></p>
                     <p><strong>1.	Provenance of the Terms and Conditions</strong></p>
                     <p>a.	These terms and the offer letter (together the “Terms and Conditions”) set out the terms that apply between (1) the institutions Colorado State University (the “University”) and the INTO Colorado State University Center (“INTO CSU” or the “Center”) and (2) students (“Students”) in relation to the INTO CSU Pathway and Academic English Programs (each constituting a “Program”). These Terms and Conditions are effective upon the completion of the confirmation process, as detailed in Section 3 below. These Terms and Conditions supersede any promises, representations and warranties, whether written or oral, made by or on behalf of the student, INTO CSU and/or the University. The University and/or INTO CSU reserve the right to amend the Terms and Conditions as needed. In such circumstances, the University and/or INTO CSU will provide the student with a revised set of Terms and Conditions upon request.</p>
                     <p>b.	The Students should read the Terms and Conditions very carefully before signing and submitting both their application for and acceptance of admission to INTO CSU.</p>
                     <p>c.	The policies, terms, and conditions that apply to students admitted to the University (either directly or following successful completion of a Pathway program) can be found in the University General Catalog at: <a href="http://catalog.colostate.edu">catalog.colostate.edu</a> for undergraduate and graduate students and the Graduate and Professional Bulletin at: <a href="http://graduateschool.colostate.edu/prospective-students/steps-once-admitted/index.aspx">graduateschool.colostate.edu/prospective-students/steps-once-admitted/index.aspx</a> for graduate students.</p>
                     <p>d.	Program refers to an individual course of study. Programs offered by INTO CSU include Academic English (AE) and Pathway (PW). For purposes of these Terms and Conditions, all references to the AE Program include Foundations Levels.</p>
                     <p>e.	The admitted Study Plan (“Study Plan”) refers to the entire study plan applied for at the time of application or assigned as a result of INTO CSU and CSU admissions evaluation. The Study Plan may include multiple Programs and encompasses the entire period of time needed to complete all selections as anticipated during the Student’s application or INTO CSU’s/CSU’s application evaluation process.</p>
                     <p><strong>2.	Changes to these Terms and Conditions</strong></p>
                     <p>a.	INTO CSU reserves the right to vary these Terms and Conditions at any time without the consent of the Student. In such circumstances, INTO CSU will provide to current and prospective students a revised set of Terms and Conditions.&nbsp;</p>
                     <p><strong>3.	Application, Admissions, Program Offer, Confirmation and Deposits</strong></p>
                     <p>a.	Students should complete their INTO CSU application and submit it to the INTO North America Application Processing Center before the application deadline at INTOadmissions@colostate.edu</p>
                     <p>b.	On behalf of the University, INTO CSU may admit or deny applications at its absolute discretion. If INTO CSU/the University accepts and admits a Student, INTO CSU will issue to the Student a written offer of admission (including any conditions pertinent to meeting the admissions requirements) (the “Offer Letter”). Included in the Offer Letter is an acceptance form for the Student to confirm her or his acceptance of the offer of admission and fee information.</p>
                     <p>c.	In order to accept the offer, the Student must:</p>
                     <p>i.	Sign and return to INTO CSU the acceptance form confirming acceptance of the offer of his or her place in the Study Plan as indicated in the Offer Letter.</p>
                     <p>ii.	If applicable, pay a deposit as outlined in the Offer Letter. The amount of the deposit required will be shown on the statement of fees included in the Offer Letter (please refer to Section 4 for payment instructions).</p>
                     <p>iii.	Where a student has selected more than one program as part of his or her study plan, the higher deposit will be required.</p>
                     <p>iv.	By remitting a signed acceptance form and a deposit, if applicable, this completes the confirmation process and denotes acceptance of these Terms and Conditions. The Student will receive (i) a confirmation letter indicating the Student’s enrollment in the Program, (ii) an I-20 if applicable, (iii) an invoice for the remaining balance due, and (iv) a pre-departure guide.</p>
                     <p>v.	The deposit is only refundable in the event that a student is unable to meet visa entry requirements, subject to the receipt, by the date of the published start date of the Study Plan, of an official visa rejection letter.</p>
                     <p>d.	After completion of the actions listed in paragraph 3c above, the contract between the Student and INTO CSU is formed.</p>
                     <p>e.	If the student enters the United States on an I-20 based with the PW program as the ultimate study goal, the student will be bound by the PW program Terms and Conditions.</p>
                     <p>f.	The registration and legal status of all University students are subject to applicable federal and state laws. All students are bound by the regulations, policies, procedures, and codes of conduct of the University as amended periodically. These can be found at <a href="http://www.colostate.edu">www.colostate.edu</a></p>
                     <p><strong>4.	Full Payment</strong></p>
                     <p>a.	INTO CSU charges will be paid to INTO CSU in advance of the start of the Study Plan. Charges incurred at the University that are billed directly through the Student’s University account will be due monthly per electronic billing notification from the University and may be paid through the University’s RAMweb student website.</p>
                     <p>b.	Payments are to be made in US dollars. Initial deposits may be made via check, bank draft, credit card, or wire transfer.</p>
                     <p>c.	Following the deposit payment, the remaining outstanding balance must be paid no later than four (4) weeks prior to the published start date of the student's Study Plan. Banking fees may be deducted from the amount submitted. Banking fees are the responsibility of the Student and in all cases will be collected from the Student.</p>
                     <p>d.	Any variation in standard payment terms will be made only by prior agreement in writing by the Center Director of INTO CSU.</p>
                     <p>e.	Sponsored Students:</p>
                     <p>i.	If a Student is applying for a scholarship from a government sponsor, the Student will be required to either (i) pay in full or (ii) provide an official letter of financial guarantee from the sponsor within two weeks following the first day of classes for the AE and PW programs.</p>
                     <p>ii.	An official letter of financial guarantee must specify that the guarantee covers the entire term of the INTO CSU Program. The letter must indicate that the student is being sponsored to attend INTO CSU, the dates (start and end) of sponsorship, the people covered (including dependents, if applicable), and the services covered (tuition, insurance, accommodation).</p>
                     <p>iii.	Sponsors are invoiced by INTO CSU for the portion of fees for which they are responsible, including tuition, and the Student will be refunded any fees paid after the official financial guarantee is on file with INTO CSU.</p>
                     <p><strong>5.	Overdue Payment Fees</strong></p>
                     <p>a.	In cases of overdue payment of any INTO CSU charges owed by the student, INTO CSU reserves the right to charge interest on the outstanding balance. Interest will be charged at the rate of 2% per month (24% APR).</p>
                     <p>b.	INTO CSU reserves the right to notify the University to withhold the Student’s transcripts, suspend or cancel the Student’s enrollment, and to restrict the Student’s ability to register for future semesters at the University if charges are still owed by the Student at the end of her/his INTO CSU program.</p>
                     <p>c.	Overdue balances resulting from charges posted directly to the Student’s University account will be assessed monthly late payment fees of 1.5% of the past due balance until the overdue account has been paid in full. In addition, the Student will not be allowed to register for future semesters at the University; transcripts, certificates, and diplomas will be withheld; and/or enrollment will be suspended or canceled. The University reserves the right to notify INTO CSU of any penalties attached to the Student’s University account.</p>
                     <p><strong>6.	Health Insurance</strong></p>
                     <p>a.	The State of Colorado and Colorado State University require that all non-immigrant or non-domestic international students be covered by a comprehensive health insurance plan. Students are automatically enrolled in the CSU student insurance plan for the length of their accepted Program.</p>
                     <p>b.	Students may waive the insurance requirement and enrollment in the CSU student insurance plan by demonstrating via the University waiver process proof of comparable and, at minimum, equivalent coverage under another insurance plan. The Student must submit this information to CSU at least four (4) weeks prior to the Program start date.</p>
                     <p>c.	Students whose third-party insurance has not been approved by the CSU Health Network are required to carry and pay for the CSU Student Insurance as a condition of enrollment.</p>
                     <p>d.	Complete information about required coverage and the waiver process can be obtained at: <a href="http://health.colostate.edu/student-health-insurance/international-student-health-insurance">health.colostate.edu/student-health-insurance/international-student-health-insurance</a></p>
                     <p><strong>7.	Program Cancellation, Withdrawal, Change, and Transfer Policies, and Refund Accounts</strong></p>
                     <p><strong>7.1	Cancellation/Withdrawal</strong></p>
                     <p>a.	If visa entry requirements are denied, the express mail fee and the wire fee will not be refunded. Upon receipt of the visa denial letter, INTO CSU will refund the Program deposits already paid.</p>
                     <p>b.	If visa entry requirements have been met, the following cancellation charges apply:</p>
                     <p>i.	Cancelling a Program prior to the published start date will result in the following cancellation fees:</p>
                     <p>1.	AE Program (includes Students in Foundations level of AE): $2,000 cancellation fee.</p>
                     <p>2.	PW Programs (includes Students who have a PW as part of their Study Plan): $2,000 cancellation fee.</p>
                     <p>ii.	There will be no refund of Program fees, tuition, or deposits for Students who cancel, withdraw or transfer early to a&nbsp;CSU undergraduate or graduate degree Program after the published start date of the INTO CSU Program.</p>
                     <p>iii.	Students who are suspended or dismissed from INTO CSU will be charged cancellation fees and will not receive a refund for money paid for tuition or other INTO CSU or CSU charges.</p>
                     <p>c.	Cancellation of a Program by the Student includes cancellation of CSU Student Insurance if the Student does not remain at <br>
                        the University.
                     </p>
                     <p>i.	Additional cancellation fees may be assessed by the University.</p>
                     <p>ii.	Per University guidelines, a Student may retain her/his health insurance if the CSU University Health Network approves an appeal for medical reasons.</p>
                     <p>d.	INTO CSU PW Program Students will be responsible for charges associated with a withdrawal from the University. A University withdrawal must be executed when a Student needs to drop all courses and leave the University. Charges apply for a withdrawal depending on the date of the student’s withdrawal. For CSU’s policy on and charges for University withdrawal, refer to <br>
                        <a href="http://registrar.colostate.edu/registration/registration-changes/">registrar.colostate.edu/registration/registration-changes</a>
                     </p>
                     <p><strong>&nbsp;7.2	Program Change</strong></p>
                     <p>a.	Students making a change to their Program will be charged a $250 administrative fee.</p>
                     <p>b.	Students currently enrolled in a PW Program will not receive a refund if making a Program change.</p>
                     <p>c.	Students wishing to make a change to their Program must do so at least four (4) weeks prior to the published start date of their Program. To make a Program change, Students must complete the Program Change Form after meeting with their INTO CSU Academic Advisor.</p>
                     <p>d.	Students who complete the AE Program earlier than anticipated will not be penalized financially for doing so. The unused tuition and fees will be applied toward future terms in any subsequent INTO CSU Program or refunded if applicable.</p>
                     <p><strong>7.3	Transfer to Another Institution</strong></p>
                     <p>a.	If the student enters the United States on the I-20 for an AE Program and immediately requests a transfer to another program, school, college or university, no refunds will be given for the duration for the student’s first semester/session. The Student will be subject to all cancellation fees for any and all Programs, as described in Section 7.1, and any applicable housing fees as outlined in Section 8c.</p>
                     <p>b.	If a Student has agreed to attend an INTO CSU PW Program and has begun the Program, there will be no transfer or refund of any fees.&nbsp;</p>
                     <p><strong>7.4	Transfer to an INTO Partner Institution</strong></p>
                     <p>a.	If a Student is enrolled in the AE Program and transfers to an INTO Partner Institution, any INTO CSU tuition will transfer if the request is made prior to the published start date for the INTO CSU program.</p>
                     <p>b.	If the transfer request is made after the INTO CSU program’s start date, there will be no transfer of tuition for the currently enrolled term/session, but the remaining tuition paid will be transferred to the future INTO partner school.</p>
                     <p>c.	If a Student has agreed to attend an INTO CSU PW Program and has begun the Program, there will be no transfer or refund of any fees.</p>
                     <p>d.	Housing cancellation fees apply (see Section 8c).</p>
                     <p><strong>7.5	Refunds</strong></p>
                     <p>a.&nbsp;Refunds of any payments made to INTO CSU will only be made to the individual or organisation that originally paid the funds. If a third party has paid the funds on behalf of the Student we are unable to refund the funds directly to the Student and any refund will be made directly to the third party who originally paid the funds.</p>
                     <p>b. Refunds of any payments made to INTO CSU can only be made to the account from which the payment was made originally.
