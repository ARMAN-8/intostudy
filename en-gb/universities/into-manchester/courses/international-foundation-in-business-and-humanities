                <h3>How will I be assessed?</h3>
                <p>Progress is monitored by continuous assessment of coursework and by the use of class tests. The final grade for each unit is based on a mixture of coursework and end-of-course examinations.</p>
<p>Basic information will be delivered in lectures, while the individuals' understanding of the subject and their ability to utilise the information will be supported by tutorial work and by extensive e-learning provision - which will also enhance the presentational style of lectures.</p>
<p>Assessment will be by:</p>
<ul>
<li>regular coursework - assignments, unit tests, experimental report and computer use</li>
<li>mid-course and end-of-course examinations</li>
</ul>
<p>All students who pass are guaranteed a conditional place on a relevant undergraduate degree at an appropriate NCUK university.</p>
<p>To gain entry to any NCUK university, you must pass all subject modules. You will also need to have a sufficient command of English.</p>
<p>Some degree courses will require minimum grades in specific subjects. University admissions staff may also take into account previous academic attainment.</p>

                <p>Progress is monitored by continuous assessment of coursework and by the use of class tests. The final grade for each unit is based on a mixture of coursework and end-of-course examinations.</p>
<p>Basic information will be delivered in lectures, while the individuals' understanding of the subject and their ability to utilise the information will be supported by tutorial work and by extensive e-learning provision - which will also enhance the presentational style of lectures.</p>
<p>Assessment will be by:</p>
<ul>
<li>regular coursework - assignments, unit tests, experimental report and computer use</li>
<li>mid-course and end-of-course examinations</li>
</ul>
<p>All students who pass are guaranteed a conditional place on a relevant undergraduate degree at an appropriate NCUK university.</p>
<p>To gain entry to any NCUK university, you must pass all subject modules. You will also need to have a sufficient command of English.</p>
<p>Some degree courses will require minimum grades in specific subjects. University admissions staff may also take into account previous academic attainment.</p>

                <h3>How will I be assessed?</h3>
                <p>Progress is monitored by continuous assessment of coursework and by the use of class tests. The final grade for each unit is based on a mixture of coursework and end-of-course examinations.</p>
<p>Basic information will be delivered in lectures, while the individuals' understanding of the subject and their ability to utilise the information will be supported by tutorial work and by extensive e-learning provision - which will also enhance the presentational style of lectures.</p>
<p>Assessment will be by:</p>
<ul>
<li>regular coursework - assignments, unit tests, experimental report and computer use</li>
<li>mid-course and end-of-course examinations</li>
</ul>
<p>All students who pass are guaranteed a conditional place on a relevant undergraduate degree at an appropriate NCUK university.</p>
<p>To gain entry to any NCUK university, you must pass all subject modules. You will also need to have a sufficient command of English.</p>
<p>Some degree courses will require minimum grades in specific subjects. University admissions staff may also take into account previous academic attainment.</p>

                <h3>How will I be assessed?</h3>
                <p>Progress is monitored by continuous assessment of coursework and by the use of class tests. The final grade for each unit is based on a mixture of coursework and end-of-course examinations.</p>
<p>Basic information will be delivered in lectures, while the individuals' understanding of the subject and their ability to utilise the information will be supported by tutorial work and by extensive e-learning provision - which will also enhance the presentational style of lectures.</p>
<p>Assessment will be by:</p>
<ul>
<li>regular coursework - assignments, unit tests, experimental report and computer use</li>
<li>mid-course and end-of-course examinations</li>
</ul>
<p>All students who pass are guaranteed a conditional place on a relevant undergraduate degree at an appropriate NCUK university.</p>
<p>To gain entry to any NCUK university, you must pass all subject modules. You will also need to have a sufficient command of English.</p>
<p>Some degree courses will require minimum grades in specific subjects. University admissions staff may also take into account previous academic attainment.</p>

                <h3>How will I be assessed?</h3>
                <p>Progress is monitored by continuous assessment of coursework and by the use of class tests. The final grade for each unit is based on a mixture of coursework and end-of-course examinations.</p>
<p>Basic information will be delivered in lectures, while the individuals' understanding of the subject and their ability to utilise the information will be supported by tutorial work and by extensive e-learning provision - which will also enhance the presentational style of lectures.</p>
<p>Assessment will be by:</p>
<ul>
<li>regular coursework - assignments, unit tests, experimental report and computer use</li>
<li>mid-course and end-of-course examinations</li>
</ul>
<p>All students who pass are guaranteed a conditional place on a relevant undergraduate degree at an appropriate NCUK university.</p>
<p>To gain entry to any NCUK university, you must pass all subject modules. You will also need to have a sufficient command of English.</p>
<p>Some degree courses will require minimum grades in specific subjects. University admissions staff may also take into account previous academic attainment.</p>

                <h3>How will I be assessed?</h3>
                <p>Progress is monitored by continuous assessment of coursework and by the use of class tests. The final grade for each unit is based on a mixture of coursework and end-of-course examinations.</p>
<p>Basic information will be delivered in lectures, while the individuals' understanding of the subject and their ability to utilise the information will be supported by tutorial work and by extensive e-learning provision - which will also enhance the presentational style of lectures.</p>
<p>Assessment will be by:</p>
<ul>
<li>regular coursework - assignments, unit tests, experimental report and computer use</li>
<li>mid-course and end-of-course examinations</li>
</ul>
<p>All students who pass are guaranteed a conditional place on a relevant undergraduate degree at an appropriate NCUK university.</p>
<p>To gain entry to any NCUK university, you must pass all subject modules. You will also need to have a sufficient command of English.</p>
<p>Some degree courses will require minimum grades in specific subjects. University admissions staff may also take into account previous academic attainment.</p>

                <p>Progress is monitored by continuous assessment of coursework and by the use of class tests. The final grade for each unit is based on a mixture of coursework and end-of-course examinations.</p>
<p>Basic information will be delivered in lectures, while the individuals' understanding of the subject and their ability to utilise the information will be supported by tutorial work and by extensive e-learning provision - which will also enhance the presentational style of lectures.</p>
<p>Assessment will be by:</p>
<ul>
<li>regular coursework - assignments, unit tests, experimental report and computer use</li>
<li>mid-course and end-of-course examinations</li>
</ul>
<p>All students who pass are guaranteed a conditional place on a relevant undergraduate degree at an appropriate NCUK university.</p>
<p>To gain entry to any NCUK university, you must pass all subject modules. You will also need to have a sufficient command of English.</p>
<p>Some degree courses will require minimum grades in specific subjects. University admissions staff may also take into account previous academic attainment.</p>

                <h3>How will I be assessed?</h3>
                <p>Progress is monitored by continuous assessment of coursework and by the use of class tests. The final grade for each unit is based on a mixture of coursework and end-of-course examinations.</p>
<p>Basic information will be delivered in lectures, while the individuals' understanding of the subject and their ability to utilise the information will be supported by tutorial work and by extensive e-learning provision - which will also enhance the presentational style of lectures.</p>
<p>Assessment will be by:</p>
<ul>
<li>regular coursework - assignments, unit tests, experimental report and computer use</li>
<li>mid-course and end-of-course examinations</li>
</ul>
<p>All students who pass are guaranteed a conditional place on a relevant undergraduate degree at an appropriate NCUK university.</p>
<p>To gain entry to any NCUK university, you must pass all subject modules. You will also need to have a sufficient command of English.</p>
<p>Some degree courses will require minimum grades in specific subjects. University admissions staff may also take into account previous academic attainment.</p>

                <h3>How will I be assessed?</h3>
                <p>Progress is monitored by continuous assessment of coursework and by the use of class tests. The final grade for each unit is based on a mixture of coursework and end-of-course examinations.</p>
<p>Basic information will be delivered in lectures, while the individuals' understanding of the subject and their ability to utilise the information will be supported by tutorial work and by extensive e-learning provision - which will also enhance the presentational style of lectures.</p>
<p>Assessment will be by:</p>
<ul>
<li>regular coursework - assignments, unit tests, experimental report and computer use</li>
<li>mid-course and end-of-course examinations</li>
</ul>
<p>All students who pass are guaranteed a conditional place on a relevant undergraduate degree at an appropriate NCUK university.</p>
<p>To gain entry to any NCUK university, you must pass all subject modules. You will also need to have a sufficient command of English.</p>
<p>Some degree courses will require minimum grades in specific subjects. University admissions staff may also take into account previous academic attainment.</p>

                <h3>How will I be assessed?</h3>
                <p>Progress is monitored by continuous assessment of coursework and by the use of class tests. The final grade for each unit is based on a mixture of coursework and end-of-course examinations.</p>
<p>Basic information will be delivered in lectures, while the individuals' understanding of the subject and their ability to utilise the information will be supported by tutorial work and by extensive e-learning provision - which will also enhance the presentational style of lectures.</p>
<p>Assessment will be by:</p>
<ul>
<li>regular coursework - assignments, unit tests, experimental report and computer use</li>
<li>mid-course and end-of-course examinations</li>
</ul>
<p>All students who pass are guaranteed a conditional place on a relevant undergraduate degree at an appropriate NCUK university.</p>
<p>To gain entry to any NCUK university, you must pass all subject modules. You will also need to have a sufficient command of English.</p>
<p>Some degree courses will require minimum grades in specific subjects. University admissions staff may also take into account previous academic attainment.</p>
