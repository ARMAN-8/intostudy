                     <p>
                        <strong>1. Application of the Terms and Conditions<br></strong><br>a. 	These are terms and conditions of the agreement between University of Alabama Birmingham (the University) and the student. These terms and conditions are effective upon completion of the confirmation process, as detailed in Section 3 below. These terms and conditions supersede any promises, representations and warranties, whether written or oral, made by or on behalf of the student or the University.<br><br>b. 	Students should read these terms and conditions very carefully before signing their application for admission.<br><br>c. 	All students are bound by the regulations, policies and procedures of the University as amended from time to time. These can be found at: UAB’s Policies and Procedures Library at uab.edu/policies/Pages/default.aspx and in the University’s Student Handbook, Directions found at: catalog.uab.edu/student-handbook. The University may assign or subcontract in whole or in part some or all of the benefit and/or burden of this agreement without any approval from the student.<br><br>d. 	Program (program) refers to individual courses of study. Programs offered by INTO UAB include Academic English (AE), and Pathway (PW).<br><br>e. 	The admitted study plan (study plan) refers to the entire study plan submitted at the time of application. If the student has made multiple selections (AE, PW), the study plan includes multiple programs and is the entire period of time needed to complete all selections.
                     </p>
                     <p><strong>2. 	Changes to the Terms and Conditions<br></strong><br>a. 	The University reserves the right to amend the terms and conditions as needed. In such circumstances, the University will provide the student with a revised set of terms and conditions upon request.</p>
                     <p><strong>3. 	Application, Admissions, Program Offer, Confirmation and Deposit<br></strong><br>a. 	Students should complete their application and submit it to the INTO Application Processing Center.<br><br>b. 	If the student is admitted, the University will issue a written offer. As described in the offer letter, in order to accept the offer, the student must sign the acceptance letter and, if applicable, remit a deposit payment. This completes the confirmation process and denotes acceptance of these terms and conditions.<br><br>c. 	Completing the confirmation process ensures the student’s enrollment in a program and/or confirms a housing reservation and insurance. The deposit is only refundable in the event that a student is unable to meet visa entry requirements, subject to the receipt of an official visa rejection letter by the published start date of the study plan.<br><br>d. 	Where a program includes multiple programs of study, the higher deposit amount will be charged at the time of offer and will be required to be paid at the time of confirmation.<br><br>e. 	If a student enters the United States on an I-20 based on a program that includes a Pathway program as the ultimate study goal, the student will be bound by Pathway program terms and conditions and must comply with all of the requirements to maintain his or her status under the I-20 for the duration of the program.<br><br>f. 	In order to accept the offer, the student must complete the confirmation process:<br><br>i. 	Complete and return the acceptance form, confirming acceptance of the admission offer.<br><br>ii. 	Pay a deposit as described in the offer letter, which will be applied toward program costs. The amount of the deposit required will be shown in the offer letter. By remitting a deposit, a student indicates his/her acceptance of these terms and conditions.</p>
                     <p><strong>4.	Full Payment<br></strong><br>a.	The remaining outstanding balance must be paid four (4) weeks prior to the program’s published start date. Any variation to standard payment terms must be made in advance and agreed to in writing. The student will not be permitted to register for his/her program until full payment has been made.<br><br>b. 	If a student is applying for a scholarship from a government sponsor, the student will be required to either (i) pay in full or (ii) provide an official letter of financial guarantee from the sponsor by the end of the third week of classes for AE/PW programs. Students with unofficial letters of financial guarantee will be allowed to register for classes, but if the official letter of financial guarantee is not received by the deadline, students will be withdrawn from their classes and disenrolled from the INTO UAB program. An official letter of financial guarantee must specify that the guarantee covers the entire term. Sponsors will be invoiced for their portion of fees, and the student will be refunded any credit balance remaining on his/her account after payment has been received from the sponsor. Students who wish to have their University health insurance waived due to sponsor provided coverage must comply with University Student Health Services waiver requirements.</p>
                     <p><strong>5. 	Overdue Payment<br></strong><br>a. 	In cases of overdue payment, the University reserves the right to suspend or cancel enrollment for students who do not have a pre-agreed arrangement with the University in writing for late payment, and to charge interest on the outstanding balance. Interest will be charged at the rate of 2% per month (24% APR). Upon termination of a student’s enrollment, the University will also cancel the I-20 and the student will not be permitted to remain in the United States.&nbsp;</p>
                     <p><strong>6. 	Health Insurance<br></strong><br>a. 	The University requires non-resident international students to register with the UAB Health Service and to be covered by health insurance which meets the US Government visa requirements and UAB requirements. Students who have health insurance coverage that meets or exceeds the coverage offered by the International Student Insurance plan may request a waiver by completing the process through the Student Health Center. Information may be found at: &nbsp;uab.edu/studenthealth/insurance-and-waivers.&nbsp;Students unable to provide evidence of adequate coverage at the time of their application will automatically be enrolled in the current INTO UAB health insurance plan to meet enrolment conditions. Students will have the opportunity to purchase dental and/or vision plans when they arrive on campus.</p>
                     <p><strong>7. 	Cancellation, Change, Withdrawal and Transfer Policies</strong></p>

There will be no refund for students who cancel or withdraw from any INTO UAB program after the published start date. This includes students who do not arrive at UAB on or before the program start date.<br><br>b.	 Cancelling a program prior to the published start date will result in a $2,000 cancellation fee.<br><br>c. 	Students who are suspended or dismissed from INTO UAB will be charged cancellation fees and will not receive a refund for money paid for tuition or other University charges.<br><br>d. 	Cancellation of a program or study plan by the student includes cancellation of the International Student Insurance if the student does not remain at UAB. Refunds will be made for the unelapsed period of coverage minus a $50 administrative charge. Other restrictions from the health insurance provider or International Services at UAB may apply. Students are advised to check directly with International Services at: uab.edu/global/international-students-and-scholars</p>
                     <p><strong>7.2 	Change<br></strong><br>a. 	Students making a change to their study plan will be charged a $250 administrative fee. Students currently enrolled in a Pathway program will not receive a refund if making a program change. All change requests must be received prior to the published program start date.</p>
                     <p><strong>7.3 	Withdrawal<br></strong><br>a. 	There will be no refund for students who cancel or withdraw from any INTO UAB program after the published start date. If the student does not meet the conditions of the offer letter and the offer of admission is withdrawn, no cancellation fees will be payable by the student provided that the student informs INTO UAB in writing and sends evidence that the conditions have not been met. This information must be received no later than four (4) weeks before the program start date.</p>
                     <p><strong>7.4 	Transfer<br></strong><br>a. 	If the student enters the United States on the I-20 for an INTO UAB program and immediately requests a transfer to another program, school, college or university, no refunds will be given for the duration of the student’s first program with the exceptions of prorated meal plan and health insurance refunds. Any further programs or registration can be cancelled with full cancellation fees attached.<br><br>b.

If the transfer request is made after the originating program’s start date, there will no transfer of tuition for the currently enrolled term/semester, but the remaining tuition paid will be transferred to the future INTO partner school. If a student has agreed to attend an INTO UAB Pathway program, and has begun the program, there will be no transfer of any fees.</p>
                     <p><strong>8. 	Accommodations<br></strong><br>a. 	On application, students are invited to select their preferred accommodations. The University agrees to make every reasonable effort to provide the accommodations as requested. If unable to do so, the University reserves the right to provide an alternative type of accommodation which will be charged at the published rate as set out on the fees page at the end of the 2017-18 brochure. Accommodations are confirmed when full fees are paid. Fees are subject to change.</p>
                     <p>b. 	Students living in University accommodations are required to execute and abide by the terms and conditions of a Housing and Residence Life Contract, as well as the Residence Life Handbook and Student Handbook available at: uab.edu/students/housing. In the case of a conflict, these terms and conditions will control.<br><br>c.

Housing exemptions are not granted automatically.&nbsp; Each is considered as submitted.&nbsp;<br><br>v. 	The housing requirement in (c) is in effect regardless of the number of terms/semesters of Academic English required prior to the Pathway program. If the student is enrolled in the Undergraduate Pathway program, but chooses to cancel his/her program, no housing refund will be awarded. Any subsequent housing terms/semesters requested by the student will incur housing cancellation fees as detailed in these terms and conditions.&nbsp;<br><br>vi. 	A student seeking a waiver of the requirement to live in University housing for the reasons stated in sections i, ii and iii above must submit a written request to INTO UAB.</p>
                     <p><strong>8.1 	Accommodation Changes or Cancellation<br></strong><br>a. 	If a student has specified his/her intent to stay in University housing, a housing deposit must be made and the student will be responsible for housing charges for the entire term specified in his/her application form. Cancelling accommodations after payment of the INTO UAB housing deposit will result in the following cancellation fees:<br><br>i. 	For students who cancel their on-campus housing at least four (4) weeks prior to the published start date of their program or study plan, the cancellation fee will be the deposit.<br><br>ii. 	For students who do not cancel their on-campus housing at least four (4) weeks prior to the published start date of their program or study plan, the cancellation fee will be the greater of the housing deposit or the established individual daily room rate for the remainder of the housing contract. Undergraduate Pathway students who cancel their housing prior to fulfillment of the Undergraduate Pathway Housing Requirement (2 semesters) will not receive any housing refund.<br><br>iii. 	Housing exemption requests must be submitted at least four (4) weeks prior to the published start date. Exemption requests received after the 4-week deadline will be treated as cancellations, and as such will incur cancellation fees.<br><br>iv.	Students who are dismissed or suspended from their program, the University or University housing will be charged cancellation fees as outlined in these terms and conditions.<br><br>v. 	Students who fail to arrive without notifying INTO UAB will not receive a housing refund.&nbsp;<br>In all cancellation scenarios, any meal plan overages will be charged to the student, in addition to any applicable cancellation fees.<br><br>b. 	Cancellation fees may be waived based on a student petition for the following reasons:<br><br>i. 	The resident completes his or her entire program.<br><br>ii. 	The resident suffers significant and unforeseeable financial hardships outside the resident’s reasonable control.<br><br>iii. 	The resident has an unforeseen, documented medical reason which requires the resident to live off campus.<br><br>iv. 	The resident is unable to meet visa entry requirements, subject to the receipt of an official visa rejection letter.&nbsp;<br>If a waiver or cancellation has been requested and approved, charges will not be finalized until the resident vacates Housing. Additional charges may be incurred by the student if the facility has not been properly cleaned or there is lost/damaged property.<br><br>c. 	Students with a study plan that includes an Undergraduate Pathway program are required to live in University housing.</p>
                     <p><strong>9. 	Student Conduct<br></strong><br>a. 	Students are required to observe the policies, rules, and requirements of UAB, as well as laws of municipalities and counties, the State of Alabama and the United States of America, as well as comply with the conditions under which the I-20 is issued.<br><br>b. 	Students are subject to the standards of conduct as described by University rules and policies, as amended from time to time. Information regarding student conduct may be referenced at the following websites: uab.edu/students/sarc/student-conduct and web.uab.edu/policies/Pages/default.aspx<br>Failure to abide by conduct regulations and relevant laws may lead to suspension from the University and/or from INTO UAB.</p>
                     <p><strong>10. 	Appeals<br></strong><br>a. 	Students may challenge decisions through established procedures for appeals and grievances. Information on appeals procedures is available in the Student Handbook as amended from time to time.</p>
                     <p><strong>11. 	Late Arrivals<br></strong><br>a. 	All students are expected to arrive and start their program on the scheduled start date. All late arrivals must be approved in advance and will be considered on a case-by-case basis. No deposits, tuition, accommodation costs, or other fees will be refunded for late arrivals (late arrival fees may apply). Any revision of the study plan will most likely involve additional time and expenditure with regard to tuition and accommodation fees.&nbsp;NOTE: There are strict deadlines for program entrance. An unapproved late arrival may result in the student being unable to attend classes for the term/semester and/or enter the United States, and may also require that the student return to his/her country until the next available term.</p>
                     <p><strong>12. 	Late Registration<br></strong><br>a. 	All students who register on or after the first day of classes for the term/semester and who do not have prior approval to register late will be assessed a $250 Late Registration Fee. Students enrolled in the Pathway program may be assessed University late fees as well.</p>
                     <p><strong>13. 	Airport Pick-ups<br></strong><br>a. 	Requests for airport pick-up should be made at least 72 hours in advance. INTO UAB cannot guarantee a reservation request made less than 72 hours in advance, however, staff will make every attempt to accommodate late requests.<br><br>b. 	In the event a flight is cancelled or delayed, students must call the Airport Arrival telephone number published in the Pre-Departure Guide to inform INTO UAB Arrival and Housing staff of the new arrival time.</p>
                     <p><strong>14. Refunds<br></strong><br>a. Refunds of any payments made to INTO UAB will only be made to the individual or organisation that originally paid the funds. If a third party has paid the funds on behalf of the Student we are unable to refund the funds directly to the Student and any refund will be made directly to the third party who originally paid the funds.<br><br>b. Refunds of any payments made to INTO UAB can only be made to the account from which the payment was made originally. Proof of payment such as a receipt or a bank statement showing payment from that account must be produced for a refund to take place. Failure to do so may delay the refund severely or prevent it altogether.<br><br>c. Refunds will not be paid via cash. INTO UAB reserves the right not to accept any payment by cash at its own discretion.</p>
                     <p><strong>15. 	Deferral of Program Start Date<br></strong><br>a. 	All requests to defer a program must be received four (4) weeks prior to the published program start date, unless in the case of a visa denial. Students may make two (2) requests to defer the program start date without penalty. Any additional deferral requests will be charged a $300 program deferral fee. An express mail fee will be charged every time express mail is used to send program documents. Students who submit deferral requests after the 4-week deadline will be assessed program cancellation penalties.</p>
                     <p><strong>16. 	Academic Standards</strong></p>
                     <p><strong>16.1 	Academic Criteria<br></strong><br>a. 	Students are accepted into their program with the strict understanding that progression through the program and successful completion of the program, are conditional upon satisfactory attendance and successful attainment of specified progression grades. During the program orientation, all students will be made aware of the criteria for successful completion of the courses in their program. The assessment of student performance is the responsibility of the course instructor.<br><br>b. 	Students who do not meet the criteria for successful completion will not be allowed to proceed with their original program. Students may be offered advice on suitable alternative study options which may include retaking, substituting, or adding courses and/or changing their program. An alternative study plan may involve additional time and expenditure with regard to tuition and accommodation fees.<br><br>c. 	Many students find it difficult to complete all requirements for an undergraduate degree in just four (4) years of study (attending only 2 semesters per year). They typically need to enroll in one (1) or more summer terms/semesters to stay on track to graduate in four (4) years.</p>
                     <p><strong>16.2 	Academic Standing&nbsp;<br></strong><br>a. 	Students in Undergraduate Pathway programs must maintain an overall GPA of 2.0 to continue in their programs. A student who receives less than the 2.0 GPA will be on Academic Warning after one (1) semester, Academic Probation after two (2) semesters and will be academically suspended after three (3) semesters with a GPA below 2.0. Students will also be placed on Academic Warning should they receive any course grades below C. Students are required to repeat all courses for which they receive a D or F and achieve a minimum of a C grade for each of the courses. Following the University’s D/F Repeat Rule (see uab.edu/students/one-stop/policies/satisfactory-academic-progress), the original grade will be replaced with the subsequent course grade. Students on Academic Warning or Academic Probation will work closely with an advisor to devise a plan by which to return to good standing.<br><br>b. 	Students in Graduate Pathway programs must maintain a 3.0 GPA and overall satisfactory performance on pass/not pass courses to continue in their programs. A student who attains less than the required GPA after one (1) semester will be placed on Academic Probation. If the student fails to raise his/her GPA above the required minimum upon completion of the third semester, he/she will be academically dismissed. Academic Probation and Dismissal policies also apply to students should they receive any course grades below B. Students are required to repeat all courses for which they receive a C, D or F and achieve a minimum of a B grade for each of the courses. Although the courses must be repeated, the original C, D or F grade will not be replaced and will remain in GPA calculations. Students on Academic Probation will work closely with an advisor to devise a plan by which to return to good standing.<br><br>c. 	Students will be provided the appeals process as set forth in the INTO UAB Student Handbook.<br><br>d. 	Please note that a student may register in no more than two (2) semesters in the same Academic English level or Pathway English course. Students may not repeat any class more than once. If a student does not pass an Academic English or Pathway English class after two (2) attempts, he/she will be academically suspended from his/ her program and will not be admissible to UAB.</p>

Students in Academic English classes who fail to attend 90% of their classes may be placed on Attendance Probation at the end of the term/semester or session in which they are currently enrolled.<br><br>b. 	While on Attendance Probation, a student must attend over 90% of his/her classes. If a student accrues 15 absences, he/she will be dismissed from the Academic English program.<br><br>c. 	Students who miss two (2) consecutive weeks of classes will be withdrawn from the Academic English program and may resume their studies at the start of the next semester.<br><br>d. 	Students who receive a suspension due to attendance standing are not admissible to UAB.<br><br>e. 	Students who fall below an 80% attendance rate will be eligible for immediate suspension from their program and will be ineligible for return.<br><br>f. 	Students will be provided the appeals process as set forth in the INTO UAB Student Handbook.</p>
                     <p><strong>16.4 	University Progression<br></strong><br>a. 	Students who meet all progression requirements for an Undergraduate Pathway or Graduate Pathway program will be permitted to progress into the appropriate University degree program.</p>
                     <p><strong>16.5 	Vacation Terms&nbsp;<br></strong><br>a. 	Students are not eligible for a vacation term until they have completed nine (9) months in the academic program.<br><br>b. 	Pathway program students are not eligible for a vacation term during the first two (2) semesters of Pathway study regardless of how many consecutive semesters they have already studied in their program.</p>
                     <p><strong>16.6	Duration of Pathway Programs&nbsp;<br></strong><br>a. 	Pathway programs are designed to be completed in one (1), two (2) or three (3) semesters.&nbsp; Additional semesters may be granted on an as-needed basis, and are not guaranteed.&nbsp; Requests for additional semesters must be submitted to INTO UAB and will be considered on a case-by-case basis.<br><br>b. 	Undergraduate students who extend their Pathway may be allowed to take additional content courses in order to maintain full-time status. These students must achieve a C or better in all repeated Pathway courses and must maintain an overall GPA of 2.0 in order to progress. Undergraduate Pathway extension semesters are limited to 15 credit hours.<br><br>c. 	Graduate students who extend their Pathway may be allowed to take one to two additional content courses in order to maintain full-time status. These students must achieve a B or better in all extended semester courses and must achieve a 3.0 in order to progress. Graduate Pathway extension semesters are limited to 12 credit hours.</p>

                     <p><strong>17. 	Program Admissions Criteria<br></strong><br>a. 	Students are accepted in good faith into both English language and academic programs, in part, on the basis of the certification they provide to meet the admissions criteria. If, however, the results from the tests and assessment procedures upon arrival provide clear evidence that a student’s actual level of English language or academic proficiency is significantly different than claimed, or as documented, and lower than that required for their designated program, then the student will be formally advised of the results and of applicable options. Students need to be aware that if an alternative study plan is advised, there may be a significant change in study time and expenditure with regard to tuition and accommodation fees.<br><br>b. 	A student, either individually or through his/her representative, who has submitted any information, documentation or certification to meet the admissions criteria which is later found to have been falsified, inaccurate or incomplete may be subject to administrative withdrawal, disciplinary action or prosecution by the University.</p>
                     <p><strong>18. 	Student Information<br></strong><br>a.
