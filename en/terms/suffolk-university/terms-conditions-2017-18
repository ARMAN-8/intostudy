                     <p><strong>1. Terms and Conditions<br></strong><br>a. These&nbsp;are terms and conditions of the agreement&nbsp;between Suffolk (the University) and the&nbsp;student. These terms and conditions are effective&nbsp;upon completion of the confirmation process, as detailed in Section 3 below. These terms and conditions supersede any promises, representations and warranties, whether written or oral, made by or
                        on behalf of the student or the University.
                     </p>
                     <p>b. Students should read these terms and conditions very carefully before signing their application for admission.</p>
                     <p>c. All students are bound by the regulations, policies&nbsp;and procedures of the University as amended&nbsp;from time to time. These can be found in the&nbsp;<a href="http://suffolk.edu/campuslife/17425.php" target="_blank">Student Handbook</a>. The University may assign or sub- contract&nbsp;in whole or in part some or all of the benefit and/or burden of this agreement without any approval&nbsp;from the student.</p>
                     <p>d. Program (program) refers to individual courses&nbsp;of study. Programs offered by INTO Suffolk include&nbsp;Academic English (AE) and Pathway (PW).</p>
                     <p>e. The admitted study plan (study plan) refers to&nbsp;the full length of study including all INTO Suffolk&nbsp;programs to&nbsp;which a student is admitted. If a&nbsp;student has been admitted to multiple programs&nbsp;(AE, PW) and has received an I-20 based on those&nbsp;programs, the study plan includes multiple programs&nbsp;and spans the entire period of time needed&nbsp;to complete all programs.</p>
                     <p><strong>2. Changes to the Terms and Conditions
                        </strong>
                     </p>
                     <p>a. The University reserves the right to amend the&nbsp;terms and conditions as needed. In such circumstances,&nbsp;the University will provide the student&nbsp;with a revised set of terms and conditions upon&nbsp;request.</p>
                     <p>3. Program Application, Offer, Confirmation&nbsp;and Deposit</p>
                     <p><strong>3.1 Application
                        </strong>
                     </p>
                     <p>Students should complete their application and&nbsp;submit it to the INTO Application Processing&nbsp;Center.</p>
                     <p><strong>3.2 Offer
                        </strong>
                     </p>
                     <p>a. If the student is admitted, the University will&nbsp;issue a written offer. Offer letters may differ from&nbsp;the study plan&nbsp;submitted at time of application,&nbsp;depending on student qualifications. The offer&nbsp;letter will include details study plan offered, any&nbsp;required deposit(s), and instructions for confirming&nbsp;acceptance of the offer.</p>
                     <p>b. In order to accept the offer, the student must&nbsp;sign the accompanying acceptance letter and any&nbsp;required deposit(s). All deposit(s) will be applied&nbsp;toward tuition, accommodation or other charges&nbsp;associated with enrollment.</p>
                     <p><strong>3.3 Confirmation and Deposit
                        </strong>
                     </p>
                     <p>a. Receipt of the signed acceptance letter and&nbsp;deposit(s) completes the confirmation process and&nbsp;denotes acceptance of these terms and conditions.&nbsp;Upon completion of the confirmation process,&nbsp;students will receive notice of confirmation, I-20&nbsp;(as applicable), and any remaining balance.</p>
                     <p>b. Completing the confirmation process ensures&nbsp;the student’s enrollment in a program and confirms&nbsp;a housing reservation and insurance, where&nbsp;applicable.</p>
                     <p>c. Deposit(s) are only refundable in the event that a&nbsp;student is unable to meet visa entry requirements,&nbsp;subject to the receipt of an official visa rejection&nbsp;letter by the published start date of the study plan.</p>
                     <p>d. If a student enters the United States on an I-20&nbsp;based on a study plan that includes a Pathway&nbsp;program, the student will be bound by all terms and&nbsp;conditions pertaining specifically to the Pathway&nbsp;program and must comply with all of the requirements&nbsp;to maintain his or her status under the I-20&nbsp;for the duration of the program.</p>
                     <p><strong>4. Full Payment
                        </strong>

                     <p>b. If a student is applying for a scholarship from a&nbsp;government sponsor, the student will be required&nbsp;to either (i) pay in full or (ii) provide an official letter&nbsp;of financial guarantee from the sponsor by the end&nbsp;of the third week of classes. Students with unofficial&nbsp;letters of financial guarantee will be allowed&nbsp;to register for classes, but if the official letter of&nbsp;financial guarantee is not received by the deadline,&nbsp;students will be required to pay tuition and fees in&nbsp;full or be withdrawn from their classes and disenrolled&nbsp;from the INTO Suffolk program. An official&nbsp;letter of financial&nbsp;guarantee must specify that the&nbsp;guarantee covers the entire term. Sponsors will be&nbsp;invoiced for their portion of fees, and the student&nbsp;will be refunded any credit balance remaining on&nbsp;his/her account after payment has been received&nbsp;from the sponsor. Students who wish to have their&nbsp;Suffolk Student Health Insurance Plan (SSHIP)&nbsp;waived due to sponsor provided coverage must&nbsp;comply with University Health Services waiver&nbsp;requirements.</p>

In cases of overdue payment, the University&nbsp;reserves the right to suspend or cancel enrollment&nbsp;for students who do not have a pre-agreed&nbsp;arrangement with the University in writing for late&nbsp;payment, and to charge interest on the outstanding&nbsp;balance. Interest will be charged at the rate of&nbsp;2% per month (24% APR). Upon termination of a&nbsp;student’s enrollment, the University will also cancel&nbsp;the I-20 which will impact the student’s ability to&nbsp;remain in the United States.</p>

Cancellation of a program or study plan by the&nbsp;student includes cancellation of the Suffolk Student&nbsp;Health Insurance plan (SSHIP) if the student&nbsp;does not remain at the University. Students may&nbsp;only cancel enrollment in the Plan by the published&nbsp;cancellation date if no claims were submitted&nbsp;on the SSHIP Plan and they withdraw from the&nbsp;Program, are suspended or dismissed. Students&nbsp;who use the SSHIP Plan may not cancel the Plan&nbsp;and are not entitled to a refund. Other restrictions&nbsp;from the health insurance provider may apply.

                        </strong>

                     </p>
                     <p>a. If a student does not meet the conditions of the&nbsp;offer letter and the offer of admission is withdrawn,&nbsp;no cancellation fees will be required from&nbsp;the student provided that the student informs&nbsp;INTO Suffolk in writing and sends evidence that&nbsp;the conditions have not been met. This information&nbsp;must be received no later than four (4) weeks&nbsp;before the program start date.</p>
                     <p><strong>6.4 Transfer
                        </strong>
                     </p>
                     <p>a. If the student enters the United States on the&nbsp;I-20 for an INTO Suffolk program and immediately&nbsp;requests a transfer to another program, school,&nbsp;college or university, no refunds will be given for&nbsp;the duration of the student’s first program with&nbsp;the exceptions of prorated meal plan and health&nbsp;insurance refunds. Any further programs or registration&nbsp;can be cancelled with full cancellation fees&nbsp;attached.</p>
                     <p>b. If a student transfers to an INTO partner school,&nbsp;any INTO Suffolk tuition fees will transfer if the&nbsp;request is made prior to the published start for the&nbsp;originating INTO Suffolk program. If the transfer&nbsp;request is made after the originating program’s&nbsp;start date, there will no transfer of tuition for the&nbsp;currently enrolled semester, but the remaining&nbsp;tuition paid will be transferred to the future INTO&nbsp;partner school. If a student has agreed to attend&nbsp;an INTO Suffolk Pathway program, and has begun&nbsp;the program, there will be no transfer of any fees.</p>
                     <p><strong>7. Deferral of Program Start Date
                        </strong>
                     </p>
                     <p>a. All requests to defer a program must be received&nbsp;four (4) weeks prior to the published program start&nbsp;date, unless in the case of a visa denial. Students&nbsp;may make two (2) requests to defer the program&nbsp;start date without penalty. Any additional deferral&nbsp;requests will be charged a $300 program deferral&nbsp;fee. An express mail fee will be charged every time&nbsp;express mail is used to send program documents.&nbsp;Students who submit deferral requests after the&nbsp;4-week deadline will be assessed program cancellation&nbsp;penalties.</p>
                     <p><strong>8. Accommodations
                        </strong>
                     </p>
                     <p>a. On application, students are invited to select&nbsp;their preferred accommodations. The University&nbsp;agrees to make every reasonable effort to provide the accommodations as requested. If unable to do&nbsp;so, the University reserves the right to provide an&nbsp;alternative type of accommodation which will be&nbsp;charged at the published rate as set out at:&nbsp;intostudy.com/housing. Accommodations are confirmed when full fees are&nbsp;paid. Fees are subject to change.</p>
                     <p>b. Students living in University accommodations are required to abide by the&nbsp;terms and conditions of the Housing and Residence Life Contract, as well as the Housing and Residence Life Handbook available at:&nbsp;suffolk.edu/studenthandbook/17764.phps. In the case of a conflict, these terms and conditions&nbsp;will control.</p>
                     <p>c. Students whose Study Plan includes an Undergraduate Pathway program&nbsp;are required to live in University housing unless the following exemptions are&nbsp;met:</p>
                     <p>i. A sponsored student whose award doesn’t include housing.</p>
                     <p>ii. Age 22 or over at time of enrollment</p>
                     <p>d. The housing requirement is in effect regardless of the number of semesters&nbsp;of Academic English required prior to the Pathway program. If the student is&nbsp;enrolled in the Undergraduate Pathway program, but chooses to cancel his/her&nbsp;program, no housing refund will be awarded. Any subsequent housing semesters&nbsp;requested by the student will incur housing cancellation fees as detailed&nbsp;in these terms and conditions.</p>
                     <p>e. Fulfillment of the live-on requirement during Academic English or Undergraduate&nbsp;will count towards, but may not fully satisfy, any additional-on requirements of the University.</p>
                     <p>f. A student seeking a waiver of the requirement to live in University housing&nbsp;for the reasons stated in sections i and ii above must submit a written request&nbsp;to INTO Suffolk.</p>
                     <p><strong>8.1. Accommodation Changes or Cancellations
                        </strong>
                     </p>
                     <p>a. If a student has specified his/her intent to stay in University housing, a&nbsp;housing deposit must be made and the student will be responsible for housing&nbsp;charges for the entire term specified in his/her application form. Cancelling&nbsp;accommodations after payment of the INTO Suffolk housing deposit will result&nbsp;in the following cancellation fees:</p>
                     <p>i. For students who cancel their on-campus housing at least four&nbsp;(4) weeks prior to the published start date of their program or study plan, the&nbsp;cancellation fee will be the deposit.</p>
                     <p>ii. For students who do not cancel their on-campus housing at least&nbsp;four (4) weeks prior to the published start date of their program or study plan,&nbsp;the cancellation fee will be the greater of the housing deposit or the established&nbsp;individual daily room rate for the remainder of the housing contract.&nbsp;Undergraduate Pathway students who cancel their housing prior to fulfillment&nbsp;of the Undergraduate Pathway Housing Requirement will not receive any&nbsp;housing refund.</p>
                     <p>iii. Housing exemption requests must be submitted at least four&nbsp;(4) weeks prior to the published start date. Exemption requests received after&nbsp;the 4-week deadline will be treated as cancellations, and as such will incur&nbsp;cancellation fees.</p>
                     <p>iv. Students who are dismissed or suspended from their program,&nbsp;the University or University housing will be charged cancellation fees as&nbsp;outlined in these terms and conditions.</p>
                     <p>v. Students who fail to arrive without notifying INTO Suffolk will&nbsp;not receive a housing refund.</p>
                     <p>In all cancellation scenarios, any meal plan overages will not be refunded, and&nbsp;will not count toward any applicable cancellation fees.</p>
                     <p>b. Accommodation cancellation fees may be waived based on a student petition&nbsp;for the following reasons:</p>
                     <p>i. The resident completes his or her entire program.</p>
                     <p>ii. The resident suffers significant and unforeseeable financial&nbsp;hardships outside the resident’s reasonable control.</p>
                     <p>iii. The resident has an unforeseen, documented medical reason&nbsp;which requires the resident to live off campus.</p>
                     <p>iv. The resident is unable to meet visa entry requirements, subject&nbsp;to the receipt of an official visa rejection letter.&nbsp;If a waiver or cancellation has been requested and approved, charges will not&nbsp;be finalized until the resident vacates Housing. Additional charges may be&nbsp;incurred by the student if the facility has not been properly cleaned or there is&nbsp;lost/damaged property.</p>
                     <p><strong>9. Health Insurance
                        </strong>
                     </p>
                     <p>a. According to Massachusetts law, every institution of higher education&nbsp;shall require all full-time and part-time students enrolled in at least 75% of a&nbsp;full-time academic program to participate in the university-sponsored&nbsp;health&nbsp;insurance plan, or in a health benefit plan with comparable qualifying coverage.</p>
                     <p>If a student wishes to waive out of the Suffolk Student Health Insurance Plan&nbsp;(SSHIP) plan because they are enrolled in another qualifying health insurance&nbsp;plan, students must submit a waiver form by the open enrollment deadline to&nbsp;opt out of SSHIP.</p>
                     <p>b. Students unable to provide evidence of adequate coverage at the time of&nbsp;their application will automatically be enrolled in SSHIP to meet enrollment&nbsp;conditions.</p>
                     <p><strong>10. Student Conduct
                        </strong>
                     </p>
                     <p>a. Students are required to observe the policies, rules, and requirements of the&nbsp;University, as well as laws of municipalities and counties, the Commonwealth&nbsp;of Massachusetts, and the United States of America, as well as comply with&nbsp;the conditions under which the I-20 is issued.</p>
                     <p>b. Students are subject to the standards of conduct as described by University&nbsp;rules and policies, as amended from time to time. Information regarding&nbsp;student conduct may be referenced at the following website: suffolk.edu/studenthandbook/60802.php</p>
                     <p><strong>11. Appeals
                        </strong>
                     </p>
                     <p>a. Students may challenge decisions through established procedures for&nbsp;appeals and grievances. Information on appeals procedures is available in the&nbsp;Student Handbook as amended from time to time.</p>
                     <p><strong>12. Late Arrivals
                        </strong>
                     </p>
                     <p>a. All students are expected to arrive and start their program on the scheduled&nbsp;start date. All late arrivals must be approved in advance and will be considered&nbsp;on a case-by-case basis. No deposits, tuition, accommodation costs, or other&nbsp;fees will be refunded for late arrivals, and additional late arrival fees may apply.</p>
                     <p>Any revision of the study plan will most likely involve additional time and&nbsp;expenditure with regard to tuition and accommodation fees.</p>
                     <p>NOTE: There are strict deadlines for program entrance. An unapproved late arrival&nbsp;may result in the student being unable to attend classes for the semester&nbsp;and/or enter the United States, and may also require that the student return&nbsp;to his/her country until the next available term.</p>
                     <p><strong>13. Late Registration
                        </strong>
                     </p>
                     <p>a. All students who register on or after the first day of classes for the semester&nbsp;and who do not have prior approval to register late will be assessed a $250&nbsp;Late Registration Fee. Students enrolled in the Pathway program may be&nbsp;assessed University late fees as well.</p>
                     <p><strong>14. Airport Pick-ups
                        </strong>
                     </p>
                     <p>a. Requests for airport pick-up should be made at least 72 hours in advance.&nbsp;INTO Suffolk cannot guarantee a reservation request made less than 72 hours&nbsp;in advance; however, staff will make every attempt to accommodate late&nbsp;requests.</p>
                     <p>b. In the event a flight is cancelled or delayed, students must call the Airport&nbsp;Arrival telephone number published in the Welcome Guide to inform INTO&nbsp;Suffolk Arrival and Housing staff of the new arrival time.</p>
                     <p><strong>15. Notification of Refund
                        </strong>
                     </p>
                     <p>a. Refunds of any payments made to INTO Suffolk will only be made to the&nbsp;individual or organization that originally paid the funds. If a third party has paid&nbsp;the funds on behalf of the Student we are unable to refund the funds directly&nbsp;to the Student and any refund will be made directly to the third party who&nbsp;originally paid the funds.</p>
                     <p>b. Refunds of any payments made to INTO Suffolk can only be made to the&nbsp;account from which the payment was made originally. Proof of payment such&nbsp;as a receipt or a bank statement showing payment from that account must&nbsp;be produced for a refund to take place. Failure to do so may delay the refund&nbsp;severely or prevent it altogether.</p>
                     <p>c. Refunds will not be paid via cash. INTO Suffolk reserves the right not to&nbsp;accept any payment by cash at its own discretion.</p>
                     <p><strong>16. Academic Standards
                        </strong>
                     </p>
                     <p><strong>16.1 Academic Criteria
                        </strong>
                     </p>
                     <p>a. Students are accepted into their program with the strict understanding that&nbsp;progression through the program and successful completion of the program&nbsp;are conditional upon satisfactory attendance and successful&nbsp;attainment of&nbsp;specified progression grades and other requirements. During the program orientation,&nbsp;all students will be made aware of the criteria for successful completion&nbsp;of the courses in their program. The assessment of student performance&nbsp;is the responsibility of the course instructor.</p>
                     <p>b. Students who do not meet the criteria for successful completion will not be&nbsp;allowed to proceed with their original program. Students may be offered advice&nbsp;on suitable alternative study options which may include retaking, substituting,&nbsp;or adding courses and/or changing their program. An alternative study&nbsp;plan may involve additional time and expenditure with regard to tuition and&nbsp;accommodation fees.</p>
                     <p>c. Many students find it difficult to complete all requirements for an undergraduate&nbsp;degree in just four (4) years of study (attending only 2 semesters per&nbsp;year). They may need to enroll in one (1) or more additional semesters to stay&nbsp;on track to graduate in four (4) years.</p>
                     <p><strong>16.2 Academic Standing
                        </strong>
                     </p>
                     <p>a. At the conclusion of each semester, students failing to make satisfactory&nbsp;progress are reviewed by the Academic Standing Committee of their respective&nbsp;school. Suffolk University expects students to maintain an overall grade&nbsp;point average of 2.0. Failure to maintain these degree requirements may result&nbsp;in academic probation or dismissal. Students are notified in writing of any&nbsp;actions taken by the Academic Standing Committees. Actions may include the&nbsp;following:</p>
                     <p><strong>Warning:&nbsp;</strong>Students will receive a warning when their overall GPA is above 2.0, but fail to&nbsp;achieve a semester GPA of 2.0. Students who earn a GPA below 2.0 in their&nbsp;major, even if only one course has been completed, are alerted to minimum&nbsp;GPA requirements and referred for advising.&nbsp;Students who earn excess grades of “I” and/or “W” are sent a warning and may have their records frozen for advising. Students are sent a warning if any&nbsp;single grade of “F” is earned.</p>
                     <p><strong>Academic Probation:</strong>&nbsp;Students who fail to achieve a cumulative GPA of 2.0 are placed on probation&nbsp;and informed of conditions (to be met in the next semester enrolled) for continued&nbsp;matriculation. In the semester following the first probationary period&nbsp;if conditions are met and the cumulative GPA is at least 2.0, then the student&nbsp;is removed from probationary status; however, if conditions are met and the&nbsp;cumulative GPA is less than 2.0, then the student is placed on a probation&nbsp;extension. If conditions are not met, the student may be dismissed from the&nbsp;University.</p>
                     <p><strong>Academic Dismissal:&nbsp;</strong>Continued failure to make satisfactory progress will inevitably result in&nbsp;dismissal from the University. Low grade point average, unexplained semester&nbsp;absences, refusal to complete prescribed remedial coursework, unwillingness&nbsp;to honor the recommendations of the Academic Standing Committee and/or&nbsp;other specific conditions are but a few of the situations that can undermine&nbsp;satisfactory progress and constitute legitimate grounds for dismissal.</p>
                     <p>Once dismissed for scholastic failure, a student is ineligible to enroll in further&nbsp;courses at the University until s/he is readmitted by the Academic Standing&nbsp;Committee. Dismissal does not suspend a student’s responsibility to meet prior&nbsp;course commitments. Consequently, all Incomplete “I” grades will convert to “F”&nbsp;grades unless attended to within one academic year.</p>
                     <p><strong>Returning from Academic Dismissal:</strong>&nbsp;Students who have been academically dismissed may apply for readmission&nbsp;after one semester by providing the appropriate committee with a written&nbsp;letter of petition.</p>
                     <p><strong>16.3 Attendance Standing
                        </strong>
                     </p>
                     <p>a. Students in Academic English classes who fail to attend 90% of their classes&nbsp;may be placed on Attendance Probation at the end of the term/semester or&nbsp;session in which they are currently enrolled.</p>
                     <p>b. While on Attendance Probation, a student must attend over 90% of his/her&nbsp;classes. If a student accrues 15 absences, he/she will be dismissed from the&nbsp;Academic English program.</p>
                     <p>c. Students who miss two (2) consecutive weeks of classes will be withdrawn&nbsp;from the Academic English program and may resume their studies at the start&nbsp;of the next term/semester.</p>
                     <p>d. Students who receive a suspension due to attendance standing are not&nbsp;admissible to the University.</p>
                     <p>e. Students who fall below an 80% attendance rate will be eligible for immediate&nbsp;suspension from their program and will be ineligible for return.</p>
                     <p>f. Students will be provided the appeals process as set forth in the INTO&nbsp;Suffolk Student Handbook.</p>
                     <p><strong>16.4 University Progression
                        </strong>
                     </p>
                     <p>a. Students who meet all progression requirements from an Undergraduate&nbsp;Pathway or Graduate Pathway program will be permitted to progress into the&nbsp;appropriate University degree program.</p>
                     <p><strong>16.5 Vacation Terms
                        </strong>
                     </p>
                     <p>a. Students are not eligible for a vacation term until they have completed nine&nbsp;(9) months in the academic program.</p>
                     <p>b. Pathway program students are not eligible for a vacation term during the&nbsp;first two (2) terms/semesters of&nbsp;Pathway study regardless of how many consecutive&nbsp;terms/semesters they have already studied in their program.</p>
                     <p><strong><span></span>16.6 Duration of Pathway Programs
                        </strong>
                     </p>
                     <p>a. Undergraduate Pathway programs are designed to be completed in one (1),&nbsp;two (2), or three (3) semesters depending on application materials and qualifications&nbsp;provided by the student.</p>
                     <p>b. Graduate Pathway programs are designed to be completed in one (1) or two&nbsp;(2) semesters depending on application materials and qualifications provided&nbsp;by the student.</p>
                     <p>c. Initial Pathway study may be extended by one (1) semester. Students may&nbsp;appeal additional Pathway extensions beyond one (1) semester. Appeals for&nbsp;an additional Pathway extension semester will be considered by an appeals&nbsp;committee on a case-by-case basis.</p>
                     <p>b. Students who extend their Pathway may be allowed to take additional&nbsp;content courses in order to maintain full-time status under the advisement&nbsp;and approval of Program advisors.</p>
                     <p><strong>16.7 English Language and Academic Class Times and Sizes
                        </strong>
                     </p>
                     <p>a. For all English language programs, classes will normally be held Monday&nbsp;through Friday. Average class size is normally 16 students and generally will&nbsp;not exceed 24 students. Where appropriate, classes may be combined for&nbsp;university-style lectures. Classes are typically held any time between 8 am and&nbsp;8 pm.</p>
                     <p>b. For academic programs, classes will normally be held Monday through Friday.&nbsp;Lessons will typically take place in the form of classes, seminars, labs and&nbsp;workshops. Average class size is 20 and will vary depending on the learning&nbsp;format (i.e. lecture, seminar, lab practical).</p>
                     <p><strong>17. Program Admissions Criteria
                        </strong>
                     </p>
                     <p>a. Students are accepted in good faith into both Academic English and Pathway&nbsp;programs, in part, on the basis of the certification they provide to meet&nbsp;the admissions criteria. If, however, the results from the tests and assessment&nbsp;procedures upon arrival provide clear evidence that a student’s actual level&nbsp;of English language or academic proficiency is significantly different than&nbsp;claimed, or as documented, and lower than that required for their designated&nbsp;program, then the student will be formally advised of the results and of applicable&nbsp;options. Students need to be aware that if an alternative study plan is&nbsp;advised, there may be a significant change in study time and expenditure with&nbsp;regard to tuition and accommodation fees.</p>
                     <p>b. A student, either individually or through his/her representative, who has&nbsp;submitted any information, documentation or certification to meet the&nbsp;admissions criteria which is later found to have been falsified, inaccurate or&nbsp;incomplete may be subject to administrative withdrawal, disciplinary action or&nbsp;prosecution by the University.</p>
                     <p><strong>18. Student Information
                        </strong>
                     </p>
                     <p>a. At the time of application, students are requested to sign a release authorizing&nbsp;INTO Suffolk to share information about the student with designated&nbsp;officials of the University, parents and representatives. It is part of the unique&nbsp;nature of the INTO Suffolk program that our center provides constant feedback&nbsp;about academic performance and financial issues to individuals involved&nbsp;in the student’s success.</p>
                     <p>b. Students may also agree in writing that their records and achievements may&nbsp;be used for promotional purposes without notification and such consent will&nbsp;remain in effect until formally withdrawn in writing.&nbsp;</p>
                     <p><strong><span></span>19. Holidays and Dates</strong></p>

                     <p>a. INTO Suffolk abides by the guidance of the Financial Action Task Force&nbsp;(FATF) and our banking service providers in relation to taking actions to help&nbsp;prevent of money laundering and terrorist financing.</p>
                     <p>b. INTO Suffolk is bound by international banking restrictions regarding payments&nbsp;to and from certain countries. These restrictions are amended regularly&nbsp;and INTO Suffolk reserves the right to amend its payment acceptance procedures&nbsp;accordingly to ensure that it is compliant with these restrictions.</p>
                     <p>c. INTO Suffolk operates an equal opportunities admissions policy and welcomes&nbsp;applications from all students. However, INTO Suffolk reserves the right&nbsp;to refuse to admit a student where in doing so, it risks being in breach of the&nbsp;provisions set out above.</p>
                     <p>d. INTO Suffolk reserves the right to refuse to accept any payment where INTO&nbsp;Suffolk reasonably believes that in doing so, it risks being in breach of the&nbsp;provisions set out above.</p>
                     <p>e. At February 2017, in line with current global banking restrictions, INTO Suffolk&nbsp;will not accept payments from the following countries/territories: Cuba,&nbsp;Iran, Syria, North Korea, Sudan and the Crimean Peninsula.</p>
                     <p>f. Payments made from a restricted country or territory will be blocked by our&nbsp;global banking partner. In such cases, the payment will be dealt with under the&nbsp;sanctions policy of the bank to which the payment was remitted.</p>

                        </strong>
                     </p>
                     <p>a. Suffolk University has given a high priority to creating a truly multicultural,&nbsp;multiracial, gender-balanced community receptive to cultural diversity. The future&nbsp;vitality of Suffolk and other urban universities depends on their ability to&nbsp;be responsive to and provide a welcoming climate for people of many cultures.&nbsp;As part of Suffolk’s efforts to reach this goal, the University strives to create&nbsp;and actively promote a welcoming and supportive environment in order to&nbsp;recruit, hire, retain and support a culturally diverse faculty and staff. University&nbsp;policies and procedures concerning faculty and employees’ development are&nbsp;structured to encourage such diversity. Likewise, the University strives to&nbsp;actively recruit and retain a widely diverse student body. Faculty and employees&nbsp;are encouraged to actively promote such diversity and such welcoming&nbsp;environment for all. Efforts to achieve those goals will be favorably considered&nbsp;in evaluations.</p>
                     <p>The University is also committed to creating and maintaining educational&nbsp;curricula in each of its schools that incorporate the values of a multicultural&nbsp;and diverse community and that reflect the pluralism of the United States and&nbsp;the world society. This commitment is congruent with the University’s stated&nbsp;mission to prepare and education men and women to be future leaders and&nbsp;citizens who can function effectively in an evolving, pluralistic and increasing&nbsp;diverse society.</p>
                     <p>The University further seeks to ensure that student support services, academic&nbsp;support services and co-curricular programs at Suffolk University are&nbsp;sufficiently diverse to meet the needs of a multicultural student body. Alumni&nbsp;activities and community networks will also be utilized to promote the goals&nbsp;of diversity.</p>
