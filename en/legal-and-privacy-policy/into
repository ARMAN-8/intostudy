                      We are passionate about ensuring the success, and transforming the lives, 
                      of our students. We will use your personal data to

                  <p>
                      We need to have a valid reason to use your personal data. This is called the
                      "lawful basis for processing". Sometimes we might ask your permission for us to do something with
                      your personal data: for example, when you give your consent to allow us to contact you by email
                      about a new service we are providing. At other times, we don't need to ask your explicit permission
                      because we have another lawful basis for processing your personal data, and you might reasonably
                      expect us to use your personal data.

                      only in accordance with our Special Category and Criminal Offence Data Policy. The processing of criminal conviction data
                      occurs when it is necessary for us to comply with the law or for another reason where there is a substantial public
                      interest in us doing so, for example, including the processing of any visa application in line with the United Kingdom
                      Visas and Immigration requirements.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      Less commonly, we will, if necessary, use information relating to criminal convictions or alleged criminal
                      behaviour where it is necessary in relation to legal claims, where it is necessary to protect your interests,
                      or someone else's interests and you are not capable of giving your consent, or where you have already
                      made the information public.

                  <p>
                      We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance
                      with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own

                      The information we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, destinations outside
                      the European Economic Area (the "EEA"). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the
                      EEA who work for us, another INTO Entity or one of our suppliers. Such staff may be involved in advising
                      you as to which course or university you wish to apply to, helping you with your application to us or
                      providing support services as we require. By submitting your personal data to us, you are acknowledging
                      that it could be being transferred, stored or processed in a location outside the EEA. Whenever we
                      transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure an equivalent level of protection is afforded
                      to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:

                      </li>
                      <li>
                          We transfer your personal data to service providers who have agreed to contractual terms
                          approved by the European Commission which give personal data equivalent protection as in the European Union.
                      </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                      Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your
                      personal data out of the EEA. In the event that the UK leaves the EEA, or if otherwise required, we will ensure
                      that appropriate transfer mechanisms to and from the UK are put in place.

                      We place great importance on the steps we take, including use of different technologies and physical
                      and organisational measures, to protect your information from unauthorised access and against unlawful
                      processing, accidental loss, alteration, disclosure, destruction and damage.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      We have in place procedures and technologies to maintain the security of personal data from the point
                      of collection to the point of destruction. We will only transfer personal data to third parties if they
                      agree to comply with those procedures and policies, or if they put in place adequate measures themselves.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      The confidentiality of any password that enables you to access certain parts of our websites is your responsibility,
                      whether we have given you the password or you have chosen it yourself. This includes access to "My INTO". We ask you
                      to please not share your password with anyone. We will not be liable for any unauthorised transactions entered into using
                      your username, personal information and/or password.

                  <p>How long will you use my personal information for?</p>
                  <p>
                      We will retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including
                      satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements: for example, any reporting requirements we have to comply
                      ]with for UK Visas and Immigration. We may also retain it for a period after this time as may be necessary and relevant
                      to our legitimate operations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      We have in place procedures and technologies to maintain the security of personal data from the point
                      of collection to the point of destruction. We will only transfer personal data to third parties if they
                      agree to comply with those procedures and policies, or if they put in place adequate measures themselves.

                  <p>
                      We consider a number of factors in deciding how long to keep your personal data: the amount, nature, and
                      sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal
                      data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other
                      means, and the applicable legal requirements (i.e. whether particular laws mean we have to keep certain types of
                      document for a certain length of time).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for
                      statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
                      We may also retain a record of your stated objection to the processing of your personal data, including in respect
                      of an objection to receiving communications, for the sole purpose of ensuring that we can continue to respect your
                      wishes to not contact you further, during the term of your objection.

                  <p>
                      You have a number of rights in relation to your personal information under data protection law, including,
                      the right to:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                      <li>
                          <strong>Request access to your personal data</strong> (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to
                          receive a copy of the personal data that we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it;
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          <strong>Request the correction of the personal data that we hold about you</strong>. This enables you to have any incomplete
                          or inaccurate data that we hold about you corrected, although we may need to verify the accuracy of the new
                          personal data that you provide to us
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          <strong>Request erasure of your personal data</strong>. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where
                          there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or
                          remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below),
                          where we may have processed your personal data unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to
                          comply with local law. Please note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request for erasure
                          for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, when we respond to your request;
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          <strong>Object to the processing of your personal data</strong>. Where we are relying on public interest or a legitimate interest
                          (or those of a third party) you have the right to object to the processing of your personal data where there is something
                          about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts
                          on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data
                          for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling public interest or
                          legitimate interest grounds to process your personal data which override your rights and freedoms;
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          <strong>Request the restriction of processing of your personal data</strong>. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing
                          of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use
                          of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer
                          require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your
                          personal data but we need to verify whether we have overriding public interest or legitimate interest grounds to use it;
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          <strong>Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party</strong>. We will provide to you, or a third
                          party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that
                          this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use; and
                      </li>

                          <strong>Withdraw your consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data</strong>. However,
                          this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you
                          withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you
                          if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.  You can ask us to stop sending you marketing messages
                          at any time by following the "unsubscribe" (or similar) links on any marketing message sent to you or by contacting
                          us at any time.  Where you opt out of receiving these marketing messages, this will not apply to personal data provided
                          to us as a result of a purchase, product/service experience or other transactions.
